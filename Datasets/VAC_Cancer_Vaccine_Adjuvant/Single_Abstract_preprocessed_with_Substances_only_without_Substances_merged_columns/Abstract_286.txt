Abstract: Given that individuals with latent tuberculosis (TB) infection represent the major reservoir of TB infection, latency-associated antigens may be promising options for development of improved multi-antigenic TB subunit vaccine. Thus, we selected RipA, a peptidoglycan hydrolase required for efficient cell division of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), as vaccine candidate. We found that RipA elicited activation of dendritic cells (DCs) by induction of phenotypic maturation, increased production of inflammatory cytokines, and prompt stimulation of MAPK and NF-κB signaling pathways. In addition, RipA-treated DCs promoted Th1-polarzied immune responses of naïve CD4+T cells with increased proliferation and activated T cells from Mtb-infected mice, which conferred enhanced control of mycobacterial growth inside macrophages. Moreover, mice immunized with RipA formulated in GLA-SE adjuvant displayed remarkable generation of Ag-specific polyfunctional CD4+T cells in both lung and spleen. Following an either conventional or ultra-low dose aerosol challenges with 2 Mtb Beijing clinical strains, RipA/GLA-SE-immunization was not inferior to BCG by mediating protection as single Ag. Collectively, our findings highlighted that RipA could be a novel candidate as a component of multi-antigenic TB subunit vaccines.Keywords:Beijing clinical isolates; Dendritic cells; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Polyfunctional T cells; Subunit vaccine.
