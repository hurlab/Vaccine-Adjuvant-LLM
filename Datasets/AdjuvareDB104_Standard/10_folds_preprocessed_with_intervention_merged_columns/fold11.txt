NCT Number	Study Summary
NCT01479244	Study Title: Efficacy and Safety Study of NeuVax (Nelipepimut-S or E75) Vaccine to Prevent Breast Cancer Recurrence. Brief Summary: Purpose of this trial: 1. To assess the efficacy and safety of NeuVaxâ„¢ administered with adjuvant Leukine (sargramostim, GM-CSF). 2. To evaluate and compare the disease free survival (DFS) in the vaccinated and control subjects. Interventions: BIOLOGICAL: NeuVax vaccine | BIOLOGICAL: Leukine (sargramostim, GM-CSF) and water for injection.
NCT00019006	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Colon, Pancreatic, or Lung Cancer. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from mutated ras peptides may make the body build an immune response to and kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of a vaccine containing mutated ras peptides and an immune adjuvant in treating patients who have colon, pancreatic, or lung cancer. Interventions: DRUG: Detox-B adjuvant | DRUG: ras peptide cancer vaccine.
NCT00398138	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy and GM-CSF in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, or Mesothelioma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Biological therapies, such as GM-CSF, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving vaccine therapy together with GM-CSF may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy and GM-CSF in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, non-small cell lung cancer, or mesothelioma. Interventions: BIOLOGICAL: WT-1 analog peptide vaccine | BIOLOGICAL: incomplete Freund's adjuvant | BIOLOGICAL: sargramostim | GENETIC: polymerase chain reaction | OTHER: flow cytometry | OTHER: immunoenzyme technique.
NCT01341652	Study Title: Phase II PAP Plus GM-CSF Versus GM-CSF Alone for Non-metastatic Prostate Cancer. Brief Summary: The investigators are trying to find new methods to treat prostate cancer. The approach the investigators are taking is to try to enhance patients' own immune response against the cancer. In this study the investigators will be testing the effectiveness of a vaccine that may be able to help the body fight prostate cancer. Interventions: BIOLOGICAL: pTVG-HP | BIOLOGICAL: rhGM-CSF.
