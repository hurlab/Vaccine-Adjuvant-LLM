NCT Number	Study Summary
NCT01353222	Study Title: DN24-02 as Adjuvant Therapy in Subjects With High Risk HER2+ Urothelial Carcinoma. Brief Summary: This study was conducted to examine survival, disease-free survival, safety, and the magnitude of the immune response induced following administration of DN24-02 in subjects with HER2+ urothelial carcinoma.
NCT03359239	Study Title: Atezolizumab Given in Combination With a Personalized Vaccine in Patients With Urothelial Cancer. Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to determine the good and bad effects of atezolizumab given in combination with a personalized cancer vaccine in patients with urothelial cancer either after surgery to remove organ where the tumor arose (for example, removal of the bladder) or for urothelial cancer that has spread to other organs.
NCT05075122	Study Title: Tolerability and Efficacy of UV1 Vaccine in Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma Planned for First-line Treatment With Pembrolizumab. Brief Summary: The primary objective of this study is to determine the clinical performance of UV1 vaccination as add on to standard pembrolizumab treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic PD-L1 positive (CPS \>=1) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Secondary objectives are to determine the efficacy in terms of overall survival ,objective response rate and duration of response. Moreover, this study will explore patient subgroups most likely deriving benefit from a targeted immunotherapy approach combining a checkpoint inhibitor with a cancer vaccine and help to establish liquid biopsy tumor monitoring in HNSCC.
NCT00091039	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy, Chemotherapy, and Radiation Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer That Cannot Be Removed With Surgery. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining vaccine therapy with chemotherapy and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiation therapy works in treating patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be removed with surgery.
NCT00404339	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Head and Neck Cancer. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's dendritic cells mixed with peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy in treating patients with head and neck cancer.
NCT00028431	Study Title: Novel Adjuvants for Peptide-Based Melanoma Vaccines. Brief Summary: This is a study to determine the efficacy of a melanoma vaccine chemotherapy cocktail composed of CTLA-4 antibody; tyrosinase, gp100, and MART-1 peptides; and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) with or without interleukin-12 in patients with resected stage III or IV melanoma.
NCT04799431	Study Title: Neoantigen-Targeted Vaccine Combined With Anti-PD-1 Antibody for Patients With Stage IV MMR-p Colon and Pancreatic Ductal Cancer. Brief Summary: Phase 1 study evaluating feasibility, safety, and immune response to a personalized neoantigen vaccine combined with retifanlimab for MMR-p mCRC and mPDAC patients with measurable disease following first-line FOLFIRINOX/FOLFOXIRI (FFX).
NCT00551265	Study Title: Oregovomab With or Without Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer That Responded to Second-Line Chemotherapy. Brief Summary: This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects of oregovomab and to see how well it works with or without cyclophosphamide in treating patients with stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that responded to second-line chemotherapy. Monoclonal antibodies, such as oregovomab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. It is not yet known whether oregovomab is more effective when given together with or without cyclophosphamide in treating patients with stage III or stage IV ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer.
NCT00093548	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II, Stage IIIA, Stage IIIB, or Stage IVA Liver Cancer. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from DNA and a gene-modified virus may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving booster vaccinations may make a stronger immune response and prevent or delay the recurrence of liver cancer. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with stage II, stage IIIA, stage IIIB, or stage IVA liver cancer.
NCT05426148	Study Title: Lot Consistency Clinical Trial of of Recombinant HPV Bivalent Vaccine in 9 to14 Years Old Healthy Female. Brief Summary: This study is to evaluate lot-lot consistency of Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16, 18) Vaccine (Escherichia coli) .
