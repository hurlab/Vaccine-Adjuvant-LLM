Abstract: Designing effective and safe tuberculosis (TB) subunit vaccines for inhalation requires identification of appropriate antigens and adjuvants and definition of the specific areas to target in the lungs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enables high spatial resolution, but real-time anatomical and functional MRI of lungs is challenging. Here, we describe the design of a novel gadoteridol-loaded cationic adjuvant formulation 01 (CAF01) for MRI-guided vaccine delivery of the clinically tested TB subunit vaccine candidate H56/CAF01. Gadoteridol-loaded CAF01 liposomes were engineered by using a quality-by-design approach to (i) increase the mechanistic understanding of formulation factors governing the loading of gadoteridol and (ii) maximize the loading of gadoteridol in CAF01, which was confirmed by cryotransmission electron microscopy. The encapsulation efficiency and loading of gadoteridol were highly dependent on the buffer pH due to strong attractive electrostatic interactions between gadoteridol and the cationic lipid component. Optimal gadoteridol loading of CAF01 liposomes showed good in vivo stability and safety upon intrapulmonary administration into mice while generating 1.5-fold MRI signal enhancement associated with approximately 30%T1relaxation change. This formulation principle and imaging approach can potentially be used for other mucosal nanoparticle-based formulations, species, and lung pathologies, which can readily be translated for clinical use.Keywords:adjuvant; drug delivery; gadoteridol; liposomes; lung proton MRI; quality-by-design.
