Task: Extract specific vaccine adjuvant names from the provided article data. Each input consists of a PMID (unique identifier), article title, and abstract separated by tabs. Your task is to identify explicit mentions of adjuvants and pair each with the corresponding PMID.

---

### Key Instructions:
Definition of Adjuvants:
Adjuvants are substances that enhance the body’s immune response to an antigen. Focus on identifying components explicitly described as adjuvants or known to act as adjuvants in the article.

Avoid Generic Terms:
Ignore generic mentions of "adjuvant" unless accompanied by a specific name or descriptor (e.g., "Hepatitis B Core Antigen (HBcAg)" described as a Th1 adjuvant).

Exact Names:
Use the exact wording for adjuvants as mentioned in the article. Avoid paraphrasing or adding external adjuvant names not found in the text.

Maximum Outputs:
Limit to two distinct adjuvant names per article. Avoid duplicate rows.

---

### Output Format:
Produce a TSV (tab-separated values) table with the following columns:
PMID	Adjuvant Name

If multiple adjuvants are identified in a single article, each adjuvant should be listed on a separate row under the same PMID. Provide the adjuvant name exactly as mentioned in the article. Limit the output to a maximum of two distinct adjuvant names per article. Avoid duplicate rows. At the end of the output, include a line with the word "Done" to indicate the completion of processing.

PMID_22425788	Title: Evaluation of immune responses to a Plasmodium vivax CSP-based recombinant protein vaccine candidate in combination with second-generation adjuvants in mice. Abstract: Plasmodium vivax is the major cause of malaria outside of sub-Saharan Africa and causes morbidity and results in significant economic impact in developing countries. In order to produce a P. vivax vaccine for global use, we have previously reported the development of VMP001, based on the circumsporozoite protein (CSP) of P. vivax. Our interest is to evaluate second-generation vaccine formulations to identify novel combinations of adjuvants capable of inducing strong, long-lasting immune responses. In this study, groups of C57BL/6J mice were immunized subcutaneously three times with VMP001 emulsified with synthetic TLR4 (GLA) or TLR7/8 (R848) agonist in stable emulsion (SE), a combination of the TLR4 and TLR7/8 agonists, or SE alone. Sera and splenocytes were tested for the presence of antigen-specific humoral and cellular responses, respectively. All groups of mice generated high titers of anti-P. vivax IgG antibodies as detected by ELISA and immunofluorescence assay. GLA-SE promoted a shift in the antibody response to a Th1 profile, as demonstrated by the change in IgG2c/IgG1 ratio. In addition, GLA-SE induced a strong cellular immune response characterized by multi-functional, antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells secreting IL-2, TNF and IFN-Î³. In contrast, mice immunized with SE or R848-SE produced low numbers of antigen-specific CD4(+) T cells, and these T cells secreted IL-2 and TNF, but not IFN-Î³. Finally, R848-SE did not enhance the immune response compared to GLA-SE alone. Based on these results, we conclude that the combination of VMP001 and GLA-SE is highly immunogenic in mice and may serve as a potential second-generation vaccine candidate against vivax malaria.
