Abstract: The Plasmodium falciparum reticulocyte binding protein homologue 5 (PfRH5) has recently shown great promise to be developed as a vaccine candidate to prevent blood-stage malaria. However, because of its molecular complexity, most previous efforts were focused on expressing PfRH5 in its native and soluble form. Here, we describe the E. coli expression of full-length PfRH5 as inclusion bodies (IBs), followed by its high cell density fermentation at 1, 5 and 30 L scale. Denatured full-length PfRH5 was purified using a two-step chromatography process before being refolded using design of experiments (DoE). Refolded PfRH5 was further purified using size exclusion chromatography (SEC), recovering high purity antigen with an overall yield of 102 mg/L from fermentation cell harvest. Purified PfRH5 was further characterized using orthogonal analytical methods, and a short-term stability study revealed -80 Â°C as an optimum storage temperature. Moreover, refolded, and purified PfRH5, when formulated with adjuvant Glucopyranosyl A lipid stable emulsion (GLA-SE), elicited high antibody titers in BALB/c mice, proving its potential to neutralize the blood-stage malarial parasite. Here, we establish an E. coli-based process platform for the large-scale cGMP production of full-length PfRH5, enabling global malaria vaccine development efforts.Keywords:E. coli; GLA-SE; PfRH5; RP-HPLC; SDS-PAGE; SEC-HPLC.
