Abstract: Each of three colostomized laying hens received per os 0.2% L-Lysine with 48 atom-% 15N-excess (15N') labelled in alpha-position in addition to a pelleted laying hen ration of 120 g over a period of 4 days. On the following 4 days they received equal amounts of unlabelled lysine. The eggs laid during the 8 days of the experiment were separated into the white of egg, the yolk and the eggshell, and the to and heavy nitrogen in the individual fractions were determined. Above that, 17 amino acids and their atom-%15N' were determined in the 19 samples of the white and yolk of egg. Of the total 15N' from the lysine fed in the 4 days, 10.1% were found in the yolk, 10.5% in the white of egg and 1.1% in the eggshells of the eggs laid during the 8 days of the experiment. 85% of the total amino acid-15N' of the yolk and 86% of the white of egg detected to be lysine-15N'. The 15N'-amount of the other 16 amino acids was mainly concentrated in the two acid and basic amino acids. Approximately 50% of the non-lysine 15N' in the egg are contained in aspartic acid, glutamic acid, histidine and arginine. A very low incorporation of the labelled lysine only could be detected in the aromatic and sulphur-containing amino acids from both the yolk and the white of egg. 43% of the 15N' was detected in the 10 essential and semi-essential (except lysine) and 57% in the 6 non-essential amino acids of the yolk and 52% and 48% resp. of the white of egg. One can summarize that the incorporation of 15N' into the egg shows the same development as that of the labelled amino acids of the wheat protein and that 15% of the lysine-15N' could be detected in the 16 other amino acids.
