Patients with chronic hepatitis B are at risk of liver cirrhosis with associated mortality because of hepatocellular carcinoma and other complications. An important goal, therefore, is the development of an effective therapeutic vaccine against chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV). A major barrier to the development of such a vaccine is the impaired immune response to HBV antigens observed in the T cells of affected patients. One strategy to overcome these barriers is to activate mucosal T cells through the use of nasal vaccination because this may overcome the systemic immune downregulation that results from HBV infection. In addition, it may be beneficial to present additional HBV epitopes beyond those contained in the traditional hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) vaccine, for example, by using the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg). This is advantageous because HBcAg has a unique ability to act as a potent Th1 adjuvant to HbsAg, while also serving as an immunogenic target.

This study investigated the immunogenicity of a novel Advax-adjuvanted Vero cell culture candidate vaccine against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in mice and horses. The results showed that, in mice, a two-immunization, low-dose (50 ng JEV antigen) regimen with adjuvanted vaccine produced solid neutralizing immunity comparable to that elicited with live ChimeriVax-JE immunization and superior to that elicited with tenfold higher doses of a traditional non-adjuvanted JEV vaccine (JE-VAX; Biken Institute) or a newly approved alum-adjuvanted vaccine (Jespect; Novartis). Mice vaccinated with the Advax-adjuvanted, but not the unadjuvanted vaccine, were protected against live JEV challenge. Equine immunizations against JEV with Advax-formulated vaccine similarly showed enhanced vaccine immunogenicity, confirming that the adjuvant effects of Advax are not restricted to rodent models. Advax-adjuvanted JEV vaccine elicited a balanced T-helper 1 (Th1)/Th2 immune response against JEV with protective levels of cross-neutralizing antibody against other viruses belonging to the JEV serocomplex, including Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV).

Abstract: Advax is a polysaccharide-based adjuvant that potently stimulates vaccine immunogenicity without the increased reactogenicity seen with other adjuvants. This study investigated the immunogenicity of a novel Advax-adjuvanted Vero cell culture candidate vaccine against Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) in mice and horses. The results showed that, in mice, a two-immunization, low-dose (50 ng JEV antigen) regimen with adjuvanted vaccine produced solid neutralizing immunity comparable to that elicited with live ChimeriVax-JE immunization and superior to that elicited with tenfold higher doses of a traditional non-adjuvanted JEV vaccine (JE-VAX; Biken Institute) or a newly approved alum-adjuvanted vaccine (Jespect; Novartis). Mice vaccinated with the Advax-adjuvanted, but not the unadjuvanted vaccine, were protected against live JEV challenge. Equine immunizations against JEV with Advax-formulated vaccine similarly showed enhanced vaccine immunogenicity, confirming that the adjuvant effects of Advax are not restricted to rodent models. Advax-adjuvanted JEV vaccine elicited a balanced T-helper 1 (Th1)/Th2 immune response against JEV with protective levels of cross-neutralizing antibody against other viruses belonging to the JEV serocomplex, including Murray Valley encephalitis virus (MVEV). The adjuvanted JEV vaccine was well tolerated with minimal reactogenicity and no systemic toxicity in immunized animals.

A number of attempts with various degrees of success have been made to reduce or eliminate the enterotoxicity of LT and CT so they can safely be used as oral adjuvants or immunogens.

Importantly, dmLT retained the ability to function as an oral adjuvant for a coadministered antigen (tetanus toxoid) and to elicit anti-LT antibodies. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that the reduced enterotoxicity of this molecule compared to native LT or the single mutant, LT(R192G), is a consequence of increased sensitivity to proteolysis and rapid intracellular degradation in mammalian cells.

Abstract: Despite the fact that the adjuvant properties of the heat-labile enterotoxins of Escherichia coli (LT) and Vibrio cholerae (CT) have been known for more than 20 years, there are no available oral vaccines containing these molecules as adjuvants, primarily because they are both very potent enterotoxins. A number of attempts with various degrees of success have been made to reduce or eliminate the enterotoxicity of LT and CT so they can safely be used as oral adjuvants or immunogens.

Individuals most often affected are children under 5 years of age in the developing world. The existence of multiple Shigella serotypes and the heterogenic distribution of pathogenic strains, as well as emerging antibiotic resistance, require the development of a broadly protective vaccine. All Shigella spp. utilize a type III secretion system (TTSS) to initiate infection. The type III secretion apparatus (TTSA) is the molecular needle and syringe that form the energized conduit between the bacterial cytoplasm and the host cell to transport effector proteins that manipulate cellular processes to benefit the pathogen. IpaB and IpaD form a tip complex atop the TTSA needle and are required for pathogenesis. Because they are common to all virulent Shigella spp., they are ideal candidate antigens for a subunit-based, broad-spectrum vaccine.

Abstract: Shigella spp. are food- and waterborne pathogens that cause severe diarrheal and dysenteric disease associated with high morbidity and mortality. Individuals most often affected are children under 5 years of age in the developing world. The existence of multiple Shigella serotypes and the heterogenic distribution of pathogenic strains, as well as emerging antibiotic resistance, require the development of a broadly protective vaccine. All Shigella spp. utilize a type III secretion system (TTSS) to initiate infection. The type III secretion apparatus (TTSA) is the molecular needle and syringe that form the energized conduit between the bacterial cytoplasm and the host cell to transport effector proteins that manipulate cellular processes to benefit the pathogen. IpaB and IpaD form a tip complex atop the TTSA needle and are required for pathogenesis. Because they are common to all virulent Shigella spp., they are ideal candidate antigens for a subunit-based, broad-spectrum vaccine. We examined the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of IpaB and IpaD, alone or combined, coadministered with a double mutant heat-labile toxin (dmLT) from Escherichia coli, used as a mucosal adjuvant, in a mouse model of intranasal immunization and pulmonary challenge.

PvCS contains a dimorphic central repetitive fragment flanked by conserved regions that contain functional domains.Methods:We have developed a chimeric 137-mer synthetic polypeptide (PvCS-NRC) that includes the conserved region I and region II-plus and the two natural repeat variants known as VK210 and VK247. The antigenicity of PvCS-NRC was tested using human sera from PNG and Colombia endemic areas and its immunogenicity was confirmed in mice with different genetic backgrounds, the polypeptide formulated either in Alum or GLA-SE adjuvants was assessed in inbred C3H, CB6F1 and outbred ICR mice, whereas a formulation in Montanide ISA51 was tested in C3H mice.Results:Antigenicity studies indicated that the chimeric peptide is recognized by a high proportion (60-70%) of residents of malaria-endemic areas. Peptides formulated with either GLA-SE or Montanide ISA51 adjuvants induced stronger antibody responses as compared with the Alum formulation.

Abstract: Background:Plasmodium vivax circumsporozoite (PvCS) protein is a major sporozoite surface antigen involved in parasite invasion of hepatocytes and is currently being considered as vaccine candidate. PvCS contains a dimorphic central repetitive fragment flanked by conserved regions that contain functional domains.Methods:We have developed a chimeric 137-mer synthetic polypeptide (PvCS-NRC) that includes the conserved region I and region II-plus and the two natural repeat variants known as VK210 and VK247. The antigenicity of PvCS-NRC was tested using human sera from PNG and Colombia endemic areas and its immunogenicity was confirmed in mice with different genetic backgrounds, the polypeptide formulated either in Alum or GLA-SE adjuvants was assessed in inbred C3H, CB6F1 and outbred ICR mice, whereas a formulation in Montanide ISA51 was tested in C3H mice.Results:Antigenicity studies indicated that the chimeric peptide is recognized by a high proportion (60-70%) of residents of malaria-endemic areas. Peptides formulated with either GLA-SE or Montanide ISA51 adjuvants induced stronger antibody responses as compared with the Alum formulation. Sera from immunized mice as well as antigen-specific affinity purified human IgG antibodies reacted with sporozoite preparations in immunofluorescence and Western blot assays, and displayed strong in vitro inhibition of sporozoite invasion (ISI) into hepatoma cells.Conclusions:The polypeptide was recognized at high prevalence when tested against naturally induced human antibodies and was able to induce significant immunogenicity in mice.

No licensed vaccine is available, and the existing candidates are only partially effective and serotype specific. Shigella type III secretion system proteins IpaB and IpaD, which are conserved across Shigella spp., are candidates for a broadly protective, subunit-based vaccine. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of IpaB and IpaD administered intradermally (i.d.) with a double-mutant of the Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (dmLT) adjuvant using microneedles. Different dosage levels of IpaB and IpaD, with or without dmLT, were tested in mice. Vaccine delivery into the dermis, recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and Langerhans cells, and colocalization of vaccine Ag within skin-activated APC were demonstrated through histology and immunofluorescence microscopy. Ag-loaded neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and Langerhans cells remained in the tissue at least 1 wk. IpaB, IpaD, and dmLT-specific serum IgG- and IgG-secreting cells were produced following i.d. immunization. The protective efficacy was 70% against Shigella flexneri and 50% against Shigella sonnei. Similar results were obtained when the vaccine was administered intranasally, with the i.d. route requiring 25-40 times lower doses.

Abstract: Shigella is one of the leading pathogens contributing to the vast pediatric diarrheal disease burden in low-income countries. No licensed vaccine is available, and the existing candidates are only partially effective and serotype specific. Shigella type III secretion system proteins IpaB and IpaD, which are conserved across Shigella spp., are candidates for a broadly protective, subunit-based vaccine. In this study, we investigated the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of IpaB and IpaD administered intradermally (i.d.) with a double-mutant of the Escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin (dmLT) adjuvant using microneedles. Different dosage levels of IpaB and IpaD, with or without dmLT, were tested in mice. Vaccine delivery into the dermis, recruitment of neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and Langerhans cells, and colocalization of vaccine Ag within skin-activated APC were demonstrated through histology and immunofluorescence microscopy. Ag-loaded neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells, and Langerhans cells remained in the tissue at least 1 wk. IpaB, IpaD, and dmLT-specific serum IgG- and IgG-secreting cells were produced following i.d. immunization. The protective efficacy was 70% against Shigella flexneri and 50% against Shigella sonnei. Similar results were obtained when the vaccine was administered intranasally, with the i.d. route requiring 25-40 times lower doses. Distinctively, IgG was detected in mucosal secretions; secretory IgA, as well as mucosal and systemic IgA Ab-secreting cells, were seemingly absent. Vaccine-induced T cells produced IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, IL-17, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10. These results demonstrate the potential of i.d. vaccination with IpaB and IpaD to prevent Shigella infection and support further studies in humans.

To maximize the potential for rBCG vaccines to induce effective immunity against HIV, various strategies are being employed to improve its ability to prime CD8+ T cells, which play an important role in the control of HIV infections. In this study we adopted a previously described approach of incorporating glycolipids that activate CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells to enhance priming of CD8+ T cells by rBCG strains expressing an SIV Gag antigen (rBCG-SIV gag).

Abstract: Recombinant Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guèrin (rBCG) has been explored as a vector for vaccines against HIV because of its ability to induce long lasting humoral and cell mediated immune responses. To maximize the potential for rBCG vaccines to induce effective immunity against HIV, various strategies are being employed to improve its ability to prime CD8+ T cells, which play an important role in the control of HIV infections. In this study we adopted a previously described approach of incorporating glycolipids that activate CD1d-restricted natural killer T (NKT) cells to enhance priming of CD8+ T cells by rBCG strains expressing an SIV Gag antigen (rBCG-SIV gag). We found that the incorporation of the synthetic NKT activating glycolipid α-galactosylceramide (α-GC) into rBCG-SIV gag significantly enhanced CD8+ T cell responses against an immunodominant Gag epitope, compared to responses primed by unmodified rBCG-SIV gag.

To address these issues, we compared in a murine model a range of recombinant spike protein or inactivated whole-virus vaccine candidates alone or adjuvanted with either alum, CpG, or Advax, a new delta inulin-based polysaccharide adjuvant. While all vaccines protected against lethal infection, addition of adjuvant significantly increased serum neutralizing-antibody titers and reduced lung virus titers on day 3 postchallenge.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains, the leading bacterial cause of diarrhea in humans, express at least 23 immunologically different colonization factor antigens (CFAs) and two distinct enterotoxins [heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxin type Ib (STa or hSTa)]. ETEC strains expressing any one or two CFAs and either toxin cause diarrhea, therefore vaccines inducing broad immunity against a majority of CFAs, if not all, and both toxins are expected to be effective against ETEC. In this study, we applied the multiepitope fusion antigen (MEFA) strategy to construct ETEC antigens and examined antigens for broad anti-CFA and antitoxin immunogenicity. CFA MEFA CFA/I/II/IV [CVI 2014, 21(2):243-9], which carried epitopes of seven CFAs [CFA/I, CFA/II (CS1, CS2, CS3), CFA/IV (CS4, CS5, CS6)] expressed by the most prevalent and virulent ETEC strains, was genetically fused to LT-STa toxoid fusion monomer 3xSTaA14Q-dmLT or 3xSTaN12S-dmLT [IAI 2014, 82(5):1823-32] for CFA/I/II/IV-STaA14Q-dmLT and CFA/I/II/IV-STaN12S-dmLT MEFAs. Mice intraperitoneally immunized with either CFA/I/II/IV-STa-toxoid-dmLT MEFA developed antibodies specific to seven CFAs and both toxins, at levels equivalent or comparable to those induced from co-administration of the CFA/I/II/IV MEFA and toxoid fusion 3xSTaN12S-dmLT.

Abstract: Immunological heterogeneity has long been the major challenge in developing broadly effective vaccines to protect humans and animals against bacterial and viral infections. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains, the leading bacterial cause of diarrhea in humans, express at least 23 immunologically different colonization factor antigens (CFAs) and two distinct enterotoxins [heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxin type Ib (STa or hSTa)]. ETEC strains expressing any one or two CFAs and either toxin cause diarrhea, therefore vaccines inducing broad immunity against a majority of CFAs, if not all, and both toxins are expected to be effective against ETEC. In this study, we applied the multiepitope fusion antigen (MEFA) strategy to construct ETEC antigens and examined antigens for broad anti-CFA and antitoxin immunogenicity. CFA MEFA CFA/I/II/IV [CVI 2014, 21(2):243-9], which carried epitopes of seven CFAs [CFA/I, CFA/II (CS1, CS2, CS3), CFA/IV (CS4, CS5, CS6)] expressed by the most prevalent and virulent ETEC strains, was genetically fused to LT-STa toxoid fusion monomer 3xSTaA14Q-dmLT or 3xSTaN12S-dmLT [IAI 2014, 82(5):1823-32] for CFA/I/II/IV-STaA14Q-dmLT and CFA/I/II/IV-STaN12S-dmLT MEFAs. Mice intraperitoneally immunized with either CFA/I/II/IV-STa-toxoid-dmLT MEFA developed antibodies specific to seven CFAs and both toxins, at levels equivalent or comparable to those induced from co-administration of the CFA/I/II/IV MEFA and toxoid fusion 3xSTaN12S-dmLT. Moreover, induced antibodies showed in vitro adherence inhibition activities against ETEC or E. coli strains expressing these seven CFAs and neutralization activities against both toxins.

Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major contributor to this diarrheal disease burden. ETEC cause disease in the small intestine by means of colonization factors and by production of a heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and/or a small non-immunogenic heat-stable enterotoxin (ST). Overall, the majority of ETEC produce both ST and LT. LT induces secretion via an enzymatically active A-subunit (LT-A) and a pentameric, cell-binding B-subunit (LT-B). The importance of anti-LT antibodies has been demonstrated in multiple clinical and epidemiological studies, and a number of potential ETEC vaccine candidates have included LT-B as an important immunogen. However, there is limited information about the potential contribution of LT-A to development of protective immunity. In the current study, we evaluate the immune response against the A-subunit of LT as well as the A-subunit's potential as a protective antigen when administered alone or in combination with the B-subunit of LT. We evaluated human sera from individuals challenged with a prototypic wild-type ETEC strain as well as sera from individuals living in an ETEC endemic area for the presence of anti-LT, anti-LT-A and anti-LT-B antibodies. In both cases, a significant number of individuals intentionally or endemically infected with ETEC developed antibodies against both LT subunits.

Abstract: Diarrheal illness contributes to malnutrition, stunted growth, impaired cognitive development, and high morbidity rates in children worldwide. Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major contributor to this diarrheal disease burden. ETEC cause disease in the small intestine by means of colonization factors and by production of a heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and/or a small non-immunogenic heat-stable enterotoxin (ST). Overall, the majority of ETEC produce both ST and LT. LT induces secretion via an enzymatically active A-subunit (LT-A) and a pentameric, cell-binding B-subunit (LT-B). The importance of anti-LT antibodies has been demonstrated in multiple clinical and epidemiological studies, and a number of potential ETEC vaccine candidates have included LT-B as an important immunogen. However, there is limited information about the potential contribution of LT-A to development of protective immunity. In the current study, we evaluate the immune response against the A-subunit of LT as well as the A-subunit's potential as a protective antigen when administered alone or in combination with the B-subunit of LT. We evaluated human sera from individuals challenged with a prototypic wild-type ETEC strain as well as sera from individuals living in an ETEC endemic area for the presence of anti-LT, anti-LT-A and anti-LT-B antibodies. In both cases, a significant number of individuals intentionally or endemically infected with ETEC developed antibodies against both LT subunits. In addition, animals immunized with the recombinant proteins developed robust antibody responses that were able to neutralize the enterotoxic and cytotoxic effects of native LT by blocking binding and entry into cells (anti-LT-B) or the intracellular enzymatic activity of the toxin (anti-LT-A). Moreover, antibodies to both LT subunits acted synergistically to neutralize the holotoxin when combined. Taken together, these data support the inclusion of both LT-A and LT-B in prospective vaccines against ETEC.

The use of this clinically relevant isolate of M. tuberculosis increases the possibilities of assessing the long-lived efficacy of tuberculosis vaccines in a relatively inexpensive small animal model. This model will also allow for the use of knockout mouse strains to critically examine key immunological factors responsible for long-lived, vaccine-induced immunity in addition to vaccine-mediated prevention of pulmonary immunopathology. In this study, we show that the ID93/glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA)-stable emulsion (SE) tuberculosis vaccine candidate, currently in human clinical trials, is able to elicit protection against M. tuberculosis HN878 by reducing the bacterial burden in the lung and spleen and by preventing the extensive lung pathology induced by this pathogen in C57BL/6 mice.

MEV consists of four inactivated E. coli strains over-expressing the major colonization factors (CFs) CFA/I, CS3, CS5 and CS6 and the LTB-related toxoid LCTBA. Memory responses were analyzed by comparing the magnitudes and kinetics of intestine-derived antibody-secreting cell responses to a single dose of MEV in three groups of adult Swedish volunteers (n=16-19 subjects per group) in a Phase I trial: non-immunized controls (I) and subjects who in a previous Phase I trial 13-23 months earlier had received two biweekly doses of MEV (II) or MEV+double mutant LT (dmLT) adjuvant (III). Responses against CFs and LTB were analyzed in antibodies in lymphocyte secretions (ALS) of blood mononuclear cells collected before (day 0) and 4/5 and 7 days after immunization. Specific circulating memory B cells present at the time of the single dose vaccination were also studied to determine if such cells may reflect mucosal memory. Considerably higher and significantly more frequent IgA ALS responses against all CFs and LTB were induced by the single vaccine dose in the previously immunized than in non-immunized volunteers. Furthermore, peak IgA ALS responses against all antigens were observed on days 4/5 in most of the previously immunized subjects whereas only a few previously non-vaccinated individuals responded before day 7. Priming with adjuvant did not influence memory responses.

Abstract: We have evaluated the capacity of an oral multivalent enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) vaccine (MEV) to induce mucosal immunological memory. MEV consists of four inactivated E. coli strains over-expressing the major colonization factors (CFs) CFA/I, CS3, CS5 and CS6 and the LTB-related toxoid LCTBA. Memory responses were analyzed by comparing the magnitudes and kinetics of intestine-derived antibody-secreting cell responses to a single dose of MEV in three groups of adult Swedish volunteers (n=16-19 subjects per group) in a Phase I trial: non-immunized controls (I) and subjects who in a previous Phase I trial 13-23 months earlier had received two biweekly doses of MEV (II) or MEV+double mutant LT (dmLT) adjuvant (III). Responses against CFs and LTB were analyzed in antibodies in lymphocyte secretions (ALS) of blood mononuclear cells collected before (day 0) and 4/5 and 7 days after immunization. Specific circulating memory B cells present at the time of the single dose vaccination were also studied to determine if such cells may reflect mucosal memory. Considerably higher and significantly more frequent IgA ALS responses against all CFs and LTB were induced by the single vaccine dose in the previously immunized than in non-immunized volunteers. Furthermore, peak IgA ALS responses against all antigens were observed on days 4/5 in most of the previously immunized subjects whereas only a few previously non-vaccinated individuals responded before day 7. Priming with adjuvant did not influence memory responses. Circulating vaccine specific IgA memory B cells were not detected, whereas anti-toxin IgG memory B cells were identified 13-23 months after priming vaccination. We conclude that MEV induces functional mucosal immunological memory which remains at least 1-2 years.

Achievement of potentially protective antibody responses against pandemic strains has usually required the use of adjuvants.Objectives:We evaluated a candidate A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5) vaccine generated by baculovirus expression of recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) protein with or without stable emulsion (SE) as an adjuvant.Methods:Healthy subjects 18-49years old were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive two doses of rHA at 7.5ug per dose (no adjuvant), or 3.8ug, 7.5ug, or 15ug per dose formulated with 2% SE separated by 21days, and serum from day 0, 21, 42, and 201 assessed by hemagglutination-inhibition.Results:341 subjects were enrolled in the study and 321 received two doses of vaccine. Vaccination was well tolerated in all groups. After two doses, seroconversion was noted in only 9% (95% confidence interval 4%, 17%) of recipients of unadjuvanted vaccine at 7.5ug, but in 70% (59%, 80%), 76% (65%, 85%), and 83% (73%, 91%) of those receiving adjuvanted vaccine at 3.8ug, 7.5ug, or 15ug respectively.Conclusions:Stable emulsion alone is an effective adjuvant for rH5 vaccine in healthy adults. All three adjuvanted dose groups met the current criterion for seroconversion rate for pandemic vaccines.

Abstract: Background:Influenza A viruses of the H5 subtype have been identified as important targets for development of vaccines. Achievement of potentially protective antibody responses against pandemic strains has usually required the use of adjuvants.Objectives:We evaluated a candidate A/Indonesia/05/2005 (H5) vaccine generated by baculovirus expression of recombinant hemagglutinin (HA) protein with or without stable emulsion (SE) as an adjuvant.Methods:Healthy subjects 18-49years old were randomized (1:1:1:1) to receive two doses of rHA at 7.5ug per dose (no adjuvant), or 3.8ug, 7.5ug, or 15ug per dose formulated with 2% SE separated by 21days, and serum from day 0, 21, 42, and 201 assessed by hemagglutination-inhibition.Results:341 subjects were enrolled in the study and 321 received two doses of vaccine. Vaccination was well tolerated in all groups. After two doses, seroconversion was noted in only 9% (95% confidence interval 4%, 17%) of recipients of unadjuvanted vaccine at 7.5ug, but in 70% (59%, 80%), 76% (65%, 85%), and 83% (73%, 91%) of those receiving adjuvanted vaccine at 3.8ug, 7.5ug, or 15ug respectively.Conclusions:Stable emulsion alone is an effective adjuvant for rH5 vaccine in healthy adults. All three adjuvanted dose groups met the current criterion for seroconversion rate for pandemic vaccines. This dose-ranging study also identified a group (15ug per dose formulated with 2% SE) that met the criteria for both seroconversion and percentage of subjects achieving an HI antibody titer⩾40.

This work describes a practical method, bacterial enzymatic combinatorial chemistry (BECC), for generating functionally diverse molecules for adjuvant use. These molecules were analyzed in cell culture for their ability to initiate immune stimulatory activity. Several of the assays described herein show promisingin vitrocytokine production and costimulatory molecule expression results, suggesting that the BECC molecules may be useful in future vaccine preparations.Keywords:TLR4; Toll-like receptors; adjuvants; immunomodulation; innate immunity; lipid A; lipopolysaccharide; memetic.

Advax™ is a novel adjuvant based on delta inulin microparticles that enhances immunity with a minimal inflammatory profile and has entered human trials to protect against viral pathogens. In this report we determined if Advax displays broad applicability against important human pathogens by assessing protective immunity against infection with M. tuberculosis. The fusion protein CysVac2, comprising the M. tuberculosis antigens Ag85B (Rv1886c) and CysD (Rv1285) formulated with Advax provided significant protection in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-infected mice. Protection was associated with the generation of CysVac2-specific multifunctional CD4+T cells (IFN-γ+TNF+IL-2+).

Abstract: There is an urgent need for the rational design of safe and effective vaccines to protect against chronic bacterial pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Advax™ is a novel adjuvant based on delta inulin microparticles that enhances immunity with a minimal inflammatory profile and has entered human trials to protect against viral pathogens. In this report we determined if Advax displays broad applicability against important human pathogens by assessing protective immunity against infection with M. tuberculosis. The fusion protein CysVac2, comprising the M. tuberculosis antigens Ag85B (Rv1886c) and CysD (Rv1285) formulated with Advax provided significant protection in the lungs of M. tuberculosis-infected mice. Protection was associated with the generation of CysVac2-specific multifunctional CD4+T cells (IFN-γ+TNF+IL-2+). Addition to Advax of the TLR9 agonist, CpG oligonucleotide (AdvaxCpG), improved both the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of CysVac2.

One strategy to improve AIT safety and efficacy is the use of new or improved adjuvants. This study investigates immune responses produced by microcrystalline tyrosine (MCT)-based vaccines as compared with conventional aluminum hydroxide (alum). Wild-type, immune-signaling-deficient, and TCR-transgenic mice were treated with different Ags (e.g., OVA and cat dander Fel d 1), plus MCT or alum as depot adjuvants. Specific Ab responses in serum were measured by ELISA, whereas cytokine secretion was measured both in culture supernatants by ELISA or by flow cytometry of spleen cells. Upon initiation of AIT in allergic mice, body temperature and further clinical signs were used as indicators for anaphylaxis. Overall, MCT and alum induced comparable B and T cell responses, which were independent of TLR signaling. Alum induced stronger IgE and IL-4 secretion than MCT.

Abstract: Allergen immunotherapy (AIT) is the only modality that can modify immune responses to allergen exposure, but therapeutic coverage is low. One strategy to improve AIT safety and efficacy is the use of new or improved adjuvants. This study investigates immune responses produced by microcrystalline tyrosine (MCT)-based vaccines as compared with conventional aluminum hydroxide (alum). Wild-type, immune-signaling-deficient, and TCR-transgenic mice were treated with different Ags (e.g., OVA and cat dander Fel d 1), plus MCT or alum as depot adjuvants. Specific Ab responses in serum were measured by ELISA, whereas cytokine secretion was measured both in culture supernatants by ELISA or by flow cytometry of spleen cells. Upon initiation of AIT in allergic mice, body temperature and further clinical signs were used as indicators for anaphylaxis. Overall, MCT and alum induced comparable B and T cell responses, which were independent of TLR signaling. Alum induced stronger IgE and IL-4 secretion than MCT. MCT and alum induced caspase-dependent IL-1β secretion in human monocytes in vitro, but inflammasome activation had no functional effect on inflammatory and Ab responses measured in vivo. In sensitized mice, AIT with MCT-adjuvanted allergens caused fewer anaphylactic reactions compared with alum-adjuvanted allergens. As depot adjuvants, MCT and alum are comparably effective in strength and mechanism of Ag-specific IgG induction and induction of T cell responses. The biocompatible and biodegradable MCT seems therefore a suitable alternative adjuvant to alum-based vaccines and AIT.

Participants were randomly assigned to receive varying doses of ID93 + GLA-SE or saline placebo at day 0, day 28, and day 112. Enrolment into each cohort was sequential. Cohort 1 participants were Mycobacterium tuberculosis uninfected (as defined by negative QuantiFERON [QFT] status), and received 10 μg ID93 plus 2 μg GLA-SE, or placebo; in cohorts 2-4, QFT-negative or positive participants received escalating doses of vaccine or placebo.

Effective vaccines contain three components: a delivery system, an antigenic component of the pathogen, and an adjuvant. With the growing use of purely recombinant or synthetic antigens, there is a need to develop novel adjuvants that enhance the protective efficacy of a vaccine against infection. Using a structure-activity relationship (SAR) model, we describe here the synthesis of a novel TLR4 ligand adjuvant compound, BECC438, by bacterial enzymatic combinatorial chemistry (BECC). This compound was identified using an in vitro screening pipeline consisting of (i) NFκB activation and cytokine production by immortalized cell lines, (ii) cytokine production by primary human PBMCs, and (iii) upregulation of surface costimulatory markers by primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Using this SAR screening regimen, BECC438 was shown to produce an innate immune activation profile comparable to the well-characterized TLR4 agonist adjuvant compound, phosphorylated hexa-acyl disaccharide (PHAD). To evaluate the in vivo adjuvant activity of BECC438, we used the known protective Yersinia pestis (Yp) antigen, rF1-V, in a murine prime-boost vaccination schedule followed by lethal challenge.

Abstract: Vaccination can significantly reduce worldwide morbidity and mortality to infectious diseases, thereby reducing the health burden as a result of microbial infections. Effective vaccines contain three components: a delivery system, an antigenic component of the pathogen, and an adjuvant. With the growing use of purely recombinant or synthetic antigens, there is a need to develop novel adjuvants that enhance the protective efficacy of a vaccine against infection. Using a structure-activity relationship (SAR) model, we describe here the synthesis of a novel TLR4 ligand adjuvant compound, BECC438, by bacterial enzymatic combinatorial chemistry (BECC). This compound was identified using an in vitro screening pipeline consisting of (i) NFκB activation and cytokine production by immortalized cell lines, (ii) cytokine production by primary human PBMCs, and (iii) upregulation of surface costimulatory markers by primary human monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Using this SAR screening regimen, BECC438 was shown to produce an innate immune activation profile comparable to the well-characterized TLR4 agonist adjuvant compound, phosphorylated hexa-acyl disaccharide (PHAD). To evaluate the in vivo adjuvant activity of BECC438, we used the known protective Yersinia pestis (Yp) antigen, rF1-V, in a murine prime-boost vaccination schedule followed by lethal challenge. In addition to providing protection from lethal challenge, BECC438 stimulated production of higher levels of rF1-V-specific total IgG as compared to PHAD after both prime and boost vaccinations. Similar to PHAD, BECC438 elicited a balanced IgG1/IgG2c response, indicative of active TH2/TH1-driven immunity. These data demonstrate that the novel BECC-derived TLR4L adjuvant, BECC438, elicits cytokine profiles in vitro similar to PHAD, induces high antigen-specific immune titers and a TH1-associated IgG2c immune titer skew, and protects mice against a lethal Yp challenge.Keywords:Adjuvant; Lipid A; Lipopolysaccharide; Toll-like receptor 4; Yersinia pestis.

Vitamin A metabolites, such as retinoic acid (RA), play crucial roles in programming T and B cells to home to mucosal compartments, therefore we evaluated the capacity of RA to elicit mucosal immune responses against tuberculosis (TB) after parenteral vaccination.

Higher amounts of IFNγ and IL-17 pro-inflammatory cytokines were found in lung homogenates of mice immunized with CAF01+H56 and RA 24 h after Mtb infection. However, 6 weeks after infection the protection was comparable in vaccinated mice with or without RA even though treatment with RA during immunization is able to better contain the inflammatory response by the host. Furthermore, at later stage of the infection a higher percentage of Mtb specific CD4+PD1+T lymphocytes were found in the lungs of mice immunized with CAF01+H56 and RA.

The higher hapten densities resulted in production of antibodies that maintained the ability to bind methamphetamine with high affinity.Conclusions:The results support continued development of IXT-v100 for the treatment of methamphetamine use disorder.Keywords:Adjuvant; Conjugate vaccine; Hapten density; Methamphetamine; Substance use disorder; Therapeutic vaccine.

This trial tested an oral, inactivated, enterotoxigenic E coli vaccine (ETVAX), which has been previously shown to be safe and highly immuongenic in Swedish and Bangladeshi adults. We tested the safety and immunogenicity of ETVAX, consisting of four E coli strains overexpressing the most prevalent colonisation factors (CFA/I, CS3, CS5, and CS6) and a toxoid (LCTBA) administered with or without a double-mutant heat-labile enterotoxin (dmLT) as an adjuvant, in Bangladeshi children.Methods:We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation, age-descending, phase 1/2 trial in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Investigators and participants were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability, assessed in all children who received at least one dose of vaccine. Antibody responses to vaccine antigens, defined as at least a two-times increase in antibody levels between baseline and post-immunisation, were assessed as secondary endpoints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02531802.Findings:Between Dec 7, 2015, and Jan 10, 2017, we screened 1500 children across the three age groups, of whom 430 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the different treatment groups (130 aged 24-59 months, 100 aged 12-23 months, and 200 aged 6-11 months). All participants received at least one dose of vaccine. No solicited adverse events occurred that were greater than moderate in severity, and most were mild. The most common solicited event was vomiting (ten [8%] of 130 patients aged 24-59 months, 13 [13%] of 100 aged 12-23 months, and 29 [15%] of 200 aged 6-11 months; mostly of mild severity), which appeared related to dose and age. The addition of dmLT did not modify the safety profile. Three serious adverse events occurred but they were not considered related to the study drug. Mucosal IgA antibody responses in lymphocyte secretions were detected against all primary vaccine antigens (CFA/I, CS3, CS5, CS6, and the LCTBA toxoid) in most participants in the two older age groups, whereas such responses to four of the five antigens were less frequent and of lower magnitude in infants aged 6-11 months than in older children. Faecal secretory IgA immune responses were recorded against all vaccine antigens in infants aged 6-11 months. 78 (56%) of 139 infants aged 6-11 months who were vaccinated developed mucosal responses against at least three of the vaccine antigens versus 14 (29%) of 49 of the infants given placebo.

This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov,NCT02531802.Findings:Between Dec 7, 2015, and Jan 10, 2017, we screened 1500 children across the three age groups, of whom 430 were enrolled and randomly assigned to the different treatment groups (130 aged 24-59 months, 100 aged 12-23 months, and 200 aged 6-11 months). All participants received at least one dose of vaccine. No solicited adverse events occurred that were greater than moderate in severity, and most were mild. The most common solicited event was vomiting (ten [8%] of 130 patients aged 24-59 months, 13 [13%] of 100 aged 12-23 months, and 29 [15%] of 200 aged 6-11 months; mostly of mild severity), which appeared related to dose and age. The addition of dmLT did not modify the safety profile. Three serious adverse events occurred but they were not considered related to the study drug. Mucosal IgA antibody responses in lymphocyte secretions were detected against all primary vaccine antigens (CFA/I, CS3, CS5, CS6, and the LCTBA toxoid) in most participants in the two older age groups, whereas such responses to four of the five antigens were less frequent and of lower magnitude in infants aged 6-11 months than in older children. Faecal secretory IgA immune responses were recorded against all vaccine antigens in infants aged 6-11 months. 78 (56%) of 139 infants aged 6-11 months who were vaccinated developed mucosal responses against at least three of the vaccine antigens versus 14 (29%) of 49 of the infants given placebo. Addition of the adjuvant dmLT enhanced the magnitude, breadth, and kinetics (based on number of responders after the first dose of vaccine) of immune responses in infants.Interpretation:The encouraging safety and immunogenicity of ETVAX and benefit of dmLT adjuvant in young children support its further assessment for protective efficacy in children in enterotoxigenic E coli-endemic areas.Funding:PATH (Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the UK's Department for International Development), the Swedish Research Council, and The Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research.

Here, we perform the first rigorous examination of LTA1's effect on antigen presenting cells (APC) using a human monocyte cell line THP-1. To better understand LTA1's stimulatory effects, we compared it to dmLT, or LT-R192G/L211A, a related AB5 adjuvant in clinical trials for oral or parenteral vaccines.

In contrast, cytokine secretion profiles were similar and dose-dependent after both LTA1 and dmLT treatment. Cellular activation by LTA1 was independent of ganglioside binding, as pre-treatment with purified GM1 blocked the effect of dmLT but not LTA1.

Young women of childbearing age are at high risk for HIV infection and, due to poor HIV testing rates and low adherence to antiretroviral therapy, are at high risk for mother-to-infant transmission. We hypothesize that HIV vaccine regimens initiated in early life would provide the necessary time frame to induce mature and highly functional Env-specific antibody responses that could potentially also protect against HIV acquisition later in life. The present study was designed to test two vaccine regimens, a clade C HIV Env protein vaccine (Env only) alone or combined with a modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vector expressing HIV Env (MVA/Env) for the induction and persistence of Env-specific antibody responses in an infant nonhuman primate model.

InPseudomonas putidaKT2440, the two pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (PQQ-ADHs) PedE and PedH are inversely regulated in response to REE availability. This transcriptional switch is orchestrated by a complex regulatory network that includes the PedR2/PedS2 two-component system and is important for efficient growth on several alcoholic volatiles. To study whether cellular responses beyond the REE switch exist, the differential proteomic responses that occur during growth on various model carbon sources were analyzed. Apart from the Ca2+-dependent enzyme PedE, the differential abundances of most identified proteins were conditional. During growth on glycerol-and concomitant with the proteomic changes-lanthanum (La3+) availability affected different growth parameters, including the onset of logarithmic growth and final optical densities. Studies with mutant strains revealed a novel metabolic route for glycerol utilization, initiated by PedE and/or PedH activity. Upon oxidation to glycerate via glyceraldehyde, phosphorylation by the glycerate kinase GarK most likely yields glycerate-2-phosphate, which is eventually channeled into the central metabolism of the cell. This new route functions in parallel with the main degradation pathway encoded by theglpFKRDoperon and provides a growth advantage to the cells by allowing an earlier onset of growth with glycerol as the sole source of carbon and energy.IMPORTANCEThe biological role of REEs has long been underestimated, and research has mainly focused on methanotrophic and methylotrophic bacteria. We have recently demonstrated thatP. putida, a plant growth-promoting bacterium that thrives in the rhizosphere of various food crops, possesses a REE-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (PedH), but knowledge about REE-specific effects on physiological traits in nonmethylotrophic bacteria is still scarce.

Abstract: Ever since the discovery of the first rare earth element (REE)-dependent enzyme, the physiological role of lanthanides has become an emerging field of research due to the environmental implications and biotechnological opportunities. InPseudomonas putidaKT2440, the two pyrroloquinoline quinone-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases (PQQ-ADHs) PedE and PedH are inversely regulated in response to REE availability. This transcriptional switch is orchestrated by a complex regulatory network that includes the PedR2/PedS2 two-component system and is important for efficient growth on several alcoholic volatiles. To study whether cellular responses beyond the REE switch exist, the differential proteomic responses that occur during growth on various model carbon sources were analyzed. Apart from the Ca2+-dependent enzyme PedE, the differential abundances of most identified proteins were conditional. During growth on glycerol-and concomitant with the proteomic changes-lanthanum (La3+) availability affected different growth parameters, including the onset of logarithmic growth and final optical densities. Studies with mutant strains revealed a novel metabolic route for glycerol utilization, initiated by PedE and/or PedH activity. Upon oxidation to glycerate via glyceraldehyde, phosphorylation by the glycerate kinase GarK most likely yields glycerate-2-phosphate, which is eventually channeled into the central metabolism of the cell. This new route functions in parallel with the main degradation pathway encoded by theglpFKRDoperon and provides a growth advantage to the cells by allowing an earlier onset of growth with glycerol as the sole source of carbon and energy.IMPORTANCEThe biological role of REEs has long been underestimated, and research has mainly focused on methanotrophic and methylotrophic bacteria. We have recently demonstrated thatP. putida, a plant growth-promoting bacterium that thrives in the rhizosphere of various food crops, possesses a REE-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (PedH), but knowledge about REE-specific effects on physiological traits in nonmethylotrophic bacteria is still scarce. This study demonstrates that the cellular response ofP. putidato lanthanum (La3+) is mostly substrate specific and that La3+availability highly affects the growth of cells on glycerol. Further, a novel route for glycerol metabolism is identified, which is initiated by PedE and/or PedH activity and provides a growth advantage to this biotechnologically relevant organism by allowing a faster onset of growth.

We previously showed that production and immunogenicity of two leading vaccine targets, PfMSP119 (blood-stage) and Pfs25 (sexual stage), could be enhanced upon genetic fusion to merozoite surface protein 8 (PfMSP8). Here, we sought to optimize a Pfs25-based formulation for use in combination with rPfMSP1/8 with the goal of maintaining the immunogenicity of each subunit.Methods:Comparative mouse studies were conducted to assess the effects of adjuvant selection (Alhydrogel vs. glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant-stable emulsion (GLA-SE)) and antigen dose (2.5 vs. 0.5 μg) on the induction of anti-Pfs25 immune responses. The antibody response (magnitude, IgG subclass profile, and transmission-reducing activity (TRA)) and cellular responses (proliferation, cytokine production) generated in response to each formulation were assessed. Similarly, immunogenicity of a bivalent vaccine containing rPfMSP1/8 and rPfs25/8 was evaluated.Results:Alum-based formulations elicited strong and comparable humoral and cellular responses regardless of antigen form (unfused rPfs25 or chimeric rPfs25/8) or dose. In contrast, GLA-SE based formulations elicited differential responses as a function of both parameters, with 2.5 μg of rPfs25/8 inducing the highest titers of functional anti-Pfs25 antibodies. Based on these data, chimeric rPfs25/8 was selected and tested in a bivalent formulation with rPfMSP1/8.

We find that i.pulmon. pull immunization of mice with H56/CAF01, which are parenterally primed with H56/CAF01, substantially enhances vaccine uptake and presentation by pulmonary and splenic APCs, pulmonary endothelial cells and type I epithelial cells and induces stronger activation of dendritic cells in the lung-draining lymph nodes, compared with parenteral immunization alone, which suggests activation of both innate and memory responses.

Development of a vaccine has been hindered by the risk of developing enhanced respiratory disease (ERD) upon natural exposure to the virus. Generation of higher quality neutralizing antibodies with stabilized pre-fusion F protein antigens has been proposed as a strategy to prevent ERD. We sought to test whether there was evidence of ERD in naïve BALB/c mice immunized with an unadjuvanted, stabilized pre-fusion F protein, and challenged with RSV line 19. We further sought to determine the extent to which formulation with a Th2-biased (alum) or a more Th1/Th2-balanced (Advax-SM) adjuvant influenced cellular responses and lung pathology. When exposed to RSV, mice immunized with pre-fusion F protein alone (PreF) exhibited increased airway eosinophilia and mucus accumulation. This was further exacerbated by formulation of PreF with Alum (aluminum hydroxide). Conversely, formulation of PreF with a Th1/Th2-balanced adjuvant, Advax-SM, not only suppressed RSV viral replication, but also inhibited airway eosinophilia and mucus accumulation. This was associated with lower numbers of lung innate lymphocyte cells (ILC2s) and CD4+ T cells producing IL-5+ or IL-13+ and increased IFNγ+ CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in addition to RSV F-specific CD8+ T cells. These data suggest that in the absence of preimmunity, stabilized PreF antigens may still be associated with aberrant Th2 responses that induce lung pathology in response to RSV infection, and can be prevented by formulation with more Th1/Th2-balanced adjuvants that enhance CD4+ and CD8+ IFNγ+ T cell responses.

We aimed to assess the safety and immunogenicity of the ID93 + GLA-SE vaccine at various doses and injection schedules in patients with previously treated tuberculosis.Methods:This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2a trial was conducted at three clinical sites near Cape Town, South Africa. Patients were recruited at local clinics after receiving 4 months of tuberculosis treatment, and screened for eligibility after providing written informed consent. Participants were aged 18-60 years, BCG-vaccinated, HIV-uninfected, and diagnosed with drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis. Eligible patients had completed standard treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis in the past 28 days. Participants were enrolled after completing standard treatment and randomly assigned sequentially to receive vaccine or placebo in three cohorts: 2 μg intramuscular ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE on days 0 and 56 (cohort 1); 10 μg ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE on days 0 and 56 (cohort 2); 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE on days 0 and 56 and placebo on day 28 (cohort 3); 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE on days 0, 28, and 56 (cohort 3); or placebo on days 0 and 56 (cohorts 1 and 2), with the placebo group for cohort 3 receiving an additional injection on day 28. Randomisation was in a ratio of 3:1 for ID93 + GLA-SE and saline placebo in cohorts 1 and 2, and in a ratio of 3:3:1 for (2 ×) ID93 + GLA-SE, (3 ×) ID93 + GLA-SE, and placebo in cohort 3. The primary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity (vaccine-specific antibody response and T-cell response). For the safety outcome, participants were observed for 30 min after each injection, injection site reactions and systemic adverse events were monitored until day 84, and serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest were monitored for 6 months after the last injection. Vaccine-specific antibody responses were measured by serum ELISA, and T-cell responses after stimulation with vaccine antigens were measured in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells specimens using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numberNCT02465216.Findings:Between June 17, 2015, and May 30, 2016, we assessed 177 patients for inclusion. 61 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive: saline placebo (n=5) or (2 ×) 2 μg ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE (n=15) on days 0 and 56 (cohort 1); saline placebo (n=2) or (2 ×) 10 μg ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE (n=5) on days 0 and 56 (cohort 2); saline placebo (n=5) on days 0, 28 and 56, or 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE (n=15) on days 0 and 56 and placebo injection on day 28, or (3 ×) 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE (n=14) on days 0, 28, and 56 (cohort 3). ID93 + GLA-SE induced robust and durable antibody responses and specific, polyfunctional CD4 T-cell responses to vaccine antigens. Two injections of the 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE dose induced antigen-specific IgG and CD4 T-cell responses that were significantly higher than those with placebo and persisted for the 6-month study duration. Mild to moderate injection site pain was reported after vaccination across all dose combinations, and induration and erythema in patients given 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE in two or three doses.

Participants were enrolled after completing standard treatment and randomly assigned sequentially to receive vaccine or placebo in three cohorts: 2 μg intramuscular ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE on days 0 and 56 (cohort 1); 10 μg ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE on days 0 and 56 (cohort 2); 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE on days 0 and 56 and placebo on day 28 (cohort 3); 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE on days 0, 28, and 56 (cohort 3); or placebo on days 0 and 56 (cohorts 1 and 2), with the placebo group for cohort 3 receiving an additional injection on day 28. Randomisation was in a ratio of 3:1 for ID93 + GLA-SE and saline placebo in cohorts 1 and 2, and in a ratio of 3:3:1 for (2 ×) ID93 + GLA-SE, (3 ×) ID93 + GLA-SE, and placebo in cohort 3. The primary outcomes were safety and immunogenicity (vaccine-specific antibody response and T-cell response). For the safety outcome, participants were observed for 30 min after each injection, injection site reactions and systemic adverse events were monitored until day 84, and serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest were monitored for 6 months after the last injection. Vaccine-specific antibody responses were measured by serum ELISA, and T-cell responses after stimulation with vaccine antigens were measured in cryopreserved peripheral blood mononuclear cells specimens using intracellular cytokine staining followed by flow cytometry. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numberNCT02465216.Findings:Between June 17, 2015, and May 30, 2016, we assessed 177 patients for inclusion. 61 eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive: saline placebo (n=5) or (2 ×) 2 μg ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE (n=15) on days 0 and 56 (cohort 1); saline placebo (n=2) or (2 ×) 10 μg ID93 + 2 μg GLA-SE (n=5) on days 0 and 56 (cohort 2); saline placebo (n=5) on days 0, 28 and 56, or 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE (n=15) on days 0 and 56 and placebo injection on day 28, or (3 ×) 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE (n=14) on days 0, 28, and 56 (cohort 3). ID93 + GLA-SE induced robust and durable antibody responses and specific, polyfunctional CD4 T-cell responses to vaccine antigens. Two injections of the 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE dose induced antigen-specific IgG and CD4 T-cell responses that were significantly higher than those with placebo and persisted for the 6-month study duration. Mild to moderate injection site pain was reported after vaccination across all dose combinations, and induration and erythema in patients given 2 μg ID93 + 5 μg GLA-SE in two or three doses. One participant had grade 3 erythema and induration at the injection site. No vaccine-related serious adverse events were observed.Interpretation:Vaccination with ID93 + GLA-SE was safe and immunogenic for all tested regimens. These data support further evaluation of ID93 + GLA-SE in therapeutic vaccination strategies to improve tuberculosis treatment outcomes.Funding:Wellcome Trust (102028/Z/13/Z).

We previously reported findings from a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 (3 μg with Algel-IMDG, 6 μg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 μg with Algel) and one Algel-only control (no antigen), with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 14. The 3 μg and 6 μg with Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for this phase 2 study. Herein, we report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 28.Methods:We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152 in healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12-65 years) at nine hospitals in India. Participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 3 μg with Algel-IMDG or 6 μg with Algel-IMDG. Block randomisation was done by use of an interactive web response system. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, study-related personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccine were administered on day 0 and day 28. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion rates (defined as a post-vaccination titre that was at least four-fold higher than the baseline titre) at 4 weeks after the second dose (day 56), measured by use of the plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) and the microneutralisation test (MNT50). The primary outcome was assessed in all participants who had received both doses of the vaccine. Cell-mediated responses were a secondary outcome and were assessed by T-helper-1 (Th1)/Th2 profiling at 2 weeks after the second dose (day 42). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine. In addition, we report immunogenicity results from a follow-up blood draw collected from phase 1 trial participants at 3 months after they received the second dose (day 104).

Abstract: Background:BBV152 is a whole-virion inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (3 μg or 6 μg) formulated with a toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist molecule (IMDG) adsorbed to alum (Algel). We previously reported findings from a double-blind, multicentre, randomised, controlled phase 1 trial on the safety and immunogenicity of three different formulations of BBV152 (3 μg with Algel-IMDG, 6 μg with Algel-IMDG, or 6 μg with Algel) and one Algel-only control (no antigen), with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 14. The 3 μg and 6 μg with Algel-IMDG formulations were selected for this phase 2 study. Herein, we report interim findings of the phase 2 trial on the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152, with the first dose administered on day 0 and the second dose on day 28.Methods:We did a double-blind, randomised, multicentre, phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of BBV152 in healthy adults and adolescents (aged 12-65 years) at nine hospitals in India. Participants with positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid and serology tests were excluded. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either 3 μg with Algel-IMDG or 6 μg with Algel-IMDG. Block randomisation was done by use of an interactive web response system. Participants, investigators, study coordinators, study-related personnel, and the sponsor were masked to treatment group allocation. Two intramuscular doses of vaccine were administered on day 0 and day 28. The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 wild-type neutralising antibody titres and seroconversion rates (defined as a post-vaccination titre that was at least four-fold higher than the baseline titre) at 4 weeks after the second dose (day 56), measured by use of the plaque-reduction neutralisation test (PRNT50) and the microneutralisation test (MNT50). The primary outcome was assessed in all participants who had received both doses of the vaccine. Cell-mediated responses were a secondary outcome and were assessed by T-helper-1 (Th1)/Th2 profiling at 2 weeks after the second dose (day 42). Safety was assessed in all participants who received at least one dose of the vaccine. In addition, we report immunogenicity results from a follow-up blood draw collected from phase 1 trial participants at 3 months after they received the second dose (day 104).

Abstract: The development of effective vaccines against fungal infections requires the induction of protective, pathogen-specific cell-mediated immune responses. Here, we asked whether combination adjuvants based on delta inulin (Advax) formulated with Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists could improve vaccine protection mediated by a fungal recombinant protein, Bl-Eng2 (i.e.,Blastomycesendoglucanase 2), which itself harbors an immunodominant antigen and dectin-2 agonist/adjuvant. We found that Bl-Eng2 formulated with Advax3 containing TLR9 agonist or Advax8 containing TLR4 agonist provided the best protection against pulmonary infection with Blastomyces dermatitidis, being more effective than complete Freund's adjuvant or Adjuplex. Advax3 was most efficient in inducing gamma interferon (IFN-γ)- and interleukin-17 (IL-17)-producing antigen-specific T cells that migrated to the lung upon Blastomyces dermatitidis infection.

Previous studies in human and non-human primate infants showed that adjuvants influenced the quality of plasma antibody responses induced by pediatric HIV envelope vaccine regimens. We recently reported that use of the 3M052-SE adjuvant and longer intervals between vaccinations are associated with higher magnitude of antibody responses in infant rhesus macaques. However, the impact of different adjuvants in HIV vaccine regimens on the developing infant B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire has not been studied. This study evaluated whether pediatric HIV envelope vaccine regimens with different adjuvants induced distinct antigen-specific memory B cell repertoires and whether specific immunoglobulin (Ig) immunogenetic characteristics are associated with higher magnitude of plasma antibody responses in vaccinated infant rhesus macaques. We utilized archived preclinical pediatric HIV vaccine studies PBMCs and tissue samples from 19 infant rhesus macaques immunized either with (i) HIV Env protein with a squalene adjuvant, (ii) MVA-HIV and Env protein co-administered using a 3-week interval, (iii) MVA-HIV prime/ protein boost with an extended 6-week interval between immunizations, or (iv) with HIV Env administered with 3M-052-SE adjuvant.

Abstract: Different HIV vaccine regimens elicit distinct plasma antibody responses in both human and nonhuman primate models. Previous studies in human and non-human primate infants showed that adjuvants influenced the quality of plasma antibody responses induced by pediatric HIV envelope vaccine regimens. We recently reported that use of the 3M052-SE adjuvant and longer intervals between vaccinations are associated with higher magnitude of antibody responses in infant rhesus macaques. However, the impact of different adjuvants in HIV vaccine regimens on the developing infant B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire has not been studied. This study evaluated whether pediatric HIV envelope vaccine regimens with different adjuvants induced distinct antigen-specific memory B cell repertoires and whether specific immunoglobulin (Ig) immunogenetic characteristics are associated with higher magnitude of plasma antibody responses in vaccinated infant rhesus macaques. We utilized archived preclinical pediatric HIV vaccine studies PBMCs and tissue samples from 19 infant rhesus macaques immunized either with (i) HIV Env protein with a squalene adjuvant, (ii) MVA-HIV and Env protein co-administered using a 3-week interval, (iii) MVA-HIV prime/ protein boost with an extended 6-week interval between immunizations, or (iv) with HIV Env administered with 3M-052-SE adjuvant. Frequencies of vaccine-elicited HIV Env-specific memory B cells from PBMCs and tissues were similar across vaccination groups (frequency range of 0.06-1.72%). There was no association between vaccine-elicited antigen-specific memory B cell frequencies and plasma antibody titer or avidity.

A protein subunit vaccine that is safe, effective, stable, has few storage restrictions, and involves a liable manufacturing process would be advantageous to distribute around the world. Here, we designed and produced a recombinant spike (S)-Trimer that is maintained in a prefusion state and exhibits a high ACE2 binding affinity. Rodents received different doses of S-Trimer (0.5, 5, or 20 μg) antigen formulated with aluminum hydroxide (Alum) or an emulsion-type adjuvant (SWE), or no adjuvant. After two vaccinations, the antibody response, T-cell responses, and number of follicular helper T-cells (Tfh) or germinal center (GC) B cells were assessed in mice; the protective efficacy was evaluated on a Syrian hamster infection model. The mouse studies demonstrated that adjuvating the S-Trimer with SWE induced a potent humoral immune response and Th1-biased cellular immune responses (in low dose) that were superior to those induced by Alum.

Abstract: During the sustained COVID-19 pandemic, global mass vaccination to achieve herd immunity can prevent further viral spread and mutation. A protein subunit vaccine that is safe, effective, stable, has few storage restrictions, and involves a liable manufacturing process would be advantageous to distribute around the world. Here, we designed and produced a recombinant spike (S)-Trimer that is maintained in a prefusion state and exhibits a high ACE2 binding affinity. Rodents received different doses of S-Trimer (0.5, 5, or 20 μg) antigen formulated with aluminum hydroxide (Alum) or an emulsion-type adjuvant (SWE), or no adjuvant. After two vaccinations, the antibody response, T-cell responses, and number of follicular helper T-cells (Tfh) or germinal center (GC) B cells were assessed in mice; the protective efficacy was evaluated on a Syrian hamster infection model. The mouse studies demonstrated that adjuvating the S-Trimer with SWE induced a potent humoral immune response and Th1-biased cellular immune responses (in low dose) that were superior to those induced by Alum. In the Syrian hamster studies, when S-Trimer was adjuvanted with SWE, higher levels of neutralizing antibodies were induced against live SARS-CoV-2 from the original lineage and against the emergence of variants (Beta or Delta) with a slightly decreased potency. In addition, the SWE adjuvant demonstrated a dose-sparing effect; thus, a lower dose of S-Trimer as an antigen (0.5 μg) can induce comparable antisera and provide complete protection from viral infection.

Typhi) non-covalently entrapped in a glutaraldehyde catalyzed, cross-linked α-poly-L-lysine and CRM197protein matrix. A previous Phase 1 trial of an aluminum phosphate adjuvanted Typhax formulation showed it induced Vi IgG after a single dose but that subsequent doses failed to further boost Vi IgG levels. The current study asked whether Advax-CpG adjuvant might instead be able to overcome polysaccharide-induced immune inhibition and improve Typhax immunogenicity. Advax-CpG adjuvanted Typhax elicited high and sustained Vi IgG responses in mice, rabbits and non-human primates (NHP) with levels being boosted by repeated immunization. High Vi antibody responses were lost in CD4 + T cell depleted mice confirming that despite the lack of conjugation of the polysaccharide to the carrier protein, Typhax nevertheless acts in a T cell dependent manner, explaining its ability to induce long-term B cell memory responses to Vi capable of being boosted.

Abstract: Typhax is an investigational typhoid fever vaccine candidate that is comprised of Vi polysaccharide from Salmonella enterica serovar typhi (S. Typhi) non-covalently entrapped in a glutaraldehyde catalyzed, cross-linked α-poly-L-lysine and CRM197protein matrix. A previous Phase 1 trial of an aluminum phosphate adjuvanted Typhax formulation showed it induced Vi IgG after a single dose but that subsequent doses failed to further boost Vi IgG levels. The current study asked whether Advax-CpG adjuvant might instead be able to overcome polysaccharide-induced immune inhibition and improve Typhax immunogenicity. Advax-CpG adjuvanted Typhax elicited high and sustained Vi IgG responses in mice, rabbits and non-human primates (NHP) with levels being boosted by repeated immunization. High Vi antibody responses were lost in CD4 + T cell depleted mice confirming that despite the lack of conjugation of the polysaccharide to the carrier protein, Typhax nevertheless acts in a T cell dependent manner, explaining its ability to induce long-term B cell memory responses to Vi capable of being boosted. In NHP, Advax-CpG adjuvanted Typhax induced up to 100-fold higher Vi IgG levels than the commercial Typhim Vi polysaccharide vaccine. Typhax induced high and sustained serum bactericidal activity against S. Typhi and stimulated robust Vi IgG responses even in animals previously primed with a pure polysaccharide vaccine. Hence Advax-CpG adjuvanted Typhax vaccine is a highly promising candidate to provide robust and durable protection against typhoid fever.

More significantly, among all the vaccine regimens tested only repRNA-ID91/ID91+GLA-SE induced IFN-γ and TNF-secreting CD8+T cells. Furthermore, the repRNA-ID91/ID91+GLA-SE vaccine strategy elicited high systemic proinflammatory cytokine responses and induced strong ID91 and an Ag85B-specific humoral antibody response a pre- and post-challenge with M. avium 2-151 smt. Finally, while all prophylactic prime/boost vaccine regimens elicited a degree of protection in beige mice, the heterologous repRNA-ID91/ID91+GLA-SE vaccine regimen provided greater pulmonary protection than the homologous protein prime/boost regimen. These data indicate that a prophylactic heterologous repRNA-ID91/ID91+GLA-SE vaccine regimen augments immunogenicity and confers protection against M. avium. Substances: Cytokines, Vaccines, DNA"

Immunogenicity and the antiviral effects of protein antigen formulations and the MVA-vector boost within TherVacB were evaluated in adeno-associated virus-HBV-infected and HBV-transgenic mice.Results:Combination adjuvant formulations preserved HBsAg and HBcAg integrity for ≥12 weeks, promoted human and mouse dendritic cell activation and, within TherVacB, elicited robust HBV-specific antibody and T-cell responses in wild-type and HBV-carrier mice.

Abstract: The outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 global pandemic heightened the pace of vaccine development with various vaccines being approved for human use in a span of 24 months. The SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike (S) surface glycoprotein, which mediates viral entry by binding to ACE2, is a key target for vaccines and therapeutic antibodies. Plant biopharming is recognized for its scalability, speed, versatility, and low production costs and is an increasingly promising molecular pharming vaccine platform for human health. We developed Nicotiana benthamiana-produced SARS-CoV-2 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine candidates displaying the S-protein of the Beta (B.1.351) variant of concern (VOC), which triggered cross-reactive neutralising antibodies against Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (B.1.1.529) VOCs. In this study, immunogenicity of the VLPs (5 µg per dose) adjuvanted with three independent adjuvants i.e. oil-in-water based adjuvants SEPIVAC SWETM(Seppic, France) and ""AS IS"" (Afrigen, South Africa) as well as a slow-release synthetic oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) adjuvant designated NADA (Disease Control Africa, South Africa) were evaluated in New Zealand white rabbits and resulted in robust neutralising antibody responses after booster vaccination, ranging from 1:5341 to as high as 1:18204. Serum neutralising antibodies elicited by the Beta variant VLP vaccine also showed cross-neutralisation against the Delta and Omicron variants with neutralising titres ranging from 1:1702 and 1:971, respectively.

We evaluated ETVAX®, an oral, inactivated ETEC vaccine containing four E. coli strains over-expressing the major colonization factors CFA/I, CS3, CS5, and CS6, a toxoid (LCTBA) and double mutant heat-labile enterotoxin (dmLT) adjuvant for safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.Methods:A double-blind, placebo-controlled, age-descending, dose-finding trial was undertaken in 40 adults, 60 children aged 10-23 months, and 146 aged 6-9 months. Adults received one full dose of ETVAX® and children received 3 doses of either 1/4 or 1/8 dose. Safety was evaluated as solicited and unsolicited events for 7 days following vaccination. Immunogenicity was assessed by evaluation of plasma IgA antibody responses to CFA/I, CS3, CS5, CS6, and LTB, and IgG responses to LTB.Results:Solicited adverse events were mostly mild or moderate with only 2 severe fever reports which were unrelated to the vaccine. The most common events were abdominal pain in adults (26.7 % in vaccinees vs 20 % in placebos), and fever in children aged 6-9 months (44 % vs 54 %). Dosage, number of vaccinations and decreasing age had no influence on severity or frequency of adverse events. The vaccine induced plasma IgA and IgG responses against LTB in 100 % of the adults and 80-90 % of the children.

Abstract: Background:Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important cause of moderate to severe diarrhoea in children for which there is no licensed vaccine. We evaluated ETVAX®, an oral, inactivated ETEC vaccine containing four E. coli strains over-expressing the major colonization factors CFA/I, CS3, CS5, and CS6, a toxoid (LCTBA) and double mutant heat-labile enterotoxin (dmLT) adjuvant for safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.Methods:A double-blind, placebo-controlled, age-descending, dose-finding trial was undertaken in 40 adults, 60 children aged 10-23 months, and 146 aged 6-9 months. Adults received one full dose of ETVAX® and children received 3 doses of either 1/4 or 1/8 dose. Safety was evaluated as solicited and unsolicited events for 7 days following vaccination. Immunogenicity was assessed by evaluation of plasma IgA antibody responses to CFA/I, CS3, CS5, CS6, and LTB, and IgG responses to LTB.Results:Solicited adverse events were mostly mild or moderate with only 2 severe fever reports which were unrelated to the vaccine. The most common events were abdominal pain in adults (26.7 % in vaccinees vs 20 % in placebos), and fever in children aged 6-9 months (44 % vs 54 %). Dosage, number of vaccinations and decreasing age had no influence on severity or frequency of adverse events. The vaccine induced plasma IgA and IgG responses against LTB in 100 % of the adults and 80-90 % of the children. In the 6-23 months cohort, IgA responses to more than 3 vaccine antigens after 3 doses determined as ≥2-fold rise was significantly higher for 1/4 dose compared to placebo (56.7 % vs 27.2 %, p = 0.01).

Although success has been achieved in initiating bnAb B cell lineages, design of boosting immunogens that select for bnAb B cell receptors with improbable mutations required for bnAb affinity maturation remains difficult. Here, we demonstrate a process for designing boosting immunogens for a V3-glycan bnAb B cell lineage.

Abstract: A major goal of HIV-1 vaccine development is the induction of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs). Although success has been achieved in initiating bnAb B cell lineages, design of boosting immunogens that select for bnAb B cell receptors with improbable mutations required for bnAb affinity maturation remains difficult. Here, we demonstrate a process for designing boosting immunogens for a V3-glycan bnAb B cell lineage. The immunogens induced affinity-matured antibodies by selecting for functional improbable mutations in bnAb precursor knockin mice. Moreover, we show similar success in prime and boosting with nucleoside-modified mRNA-encoded HIV-1 envelope trimer immunogens, with improved selection by mRNA immunogens of improbable mutations required for bnAb binding to key envelope glycans. These results demonstrate the ability of both protein and mRNA prime-boost immunogens for selection of rare B cell lineage intermediates with neutralizing breadth after bnAb precursor expansion, a key proof of concept and milestone toward development of an HIV-1 vaccine.Keywords:B cell development; HIV vaccine; affinity maturation; broadly neutralizing antibodies; improbable mutations; mRNA vaccine; vaccine design.

The aim of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) 124 was to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a unique polyvalent DNA-protein HIV vaccine with matching envelope (Env) immunogens.Methods:HVTN 124 was a randomised, phase 1, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, including participants who were HIV seronegative and aged 18-50 years at low risk for infection. The DNA vaccine comprised five plasmids: four copies expressing Env gp120 (clades A, B, C, and AE) and one gag p55 (clade C). The protein vaccine included four DNA vaccine-matched GLA-SE-adjuvanted recombinant gp120 proteins. Participants were enrolled across six clinical sites in the USA and were randomly assigned to placebo or one of two vaccine groups (ie, prime-boost or coadministration) in a 5:1 ratio in part A and a 7:1 ratio in part B. Vaccines were delivered via intramuscular needle injection. The primary outcomes were safety and tolerability, assessed via frequency, severity, and attributability of local and systemic reactogenicity and adverse events, laboratory safety measures, and early discontinuations. Part A evaluated safety. Part B evaluated safety and immunogenicity of two regimens: DNA prime (administered at months 0, 1, and 3) with protein boost (months 6 and 8), and DNA-protein coadministration (months 0, 1, 3, 6, and 8).

There were no delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions or vasculitis or any severe clinical adverse events related to vaccination. The most frequently reported systemic reactogenicity symptoms in the active vaccine groups were malaise or fatigue (five [50%] of ten in part A and 17 [81%] of 21 in the prime-boost group vs 15 [71%] of 21 in the coadministration group in part B), headache (five [50%] and 18 [86%] vs 12 [57%]), and myalgia (four [40%] and 13 [62%] vs ten [48%]), mostly of mild or moderate severity.Interpretation:Both vaccine regimens were safe, warranting evaluation in larger trials.Funding:US National Institutes of Health and US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.","AIDS Vaccines* / administration & dosage, AIDS Vaccines* / adverse effects, AIDS Vaccines* / immunology, Adolescent, Adult, Antibodies, Neutralizing / blood, Double-Blind Method, Female, HIV Antibodies* / blood, HIV Envelope Protein gp120 / genetics, HIV Envelope Protein gp120 / immunology, HIV Infections* / immunology, HIV Infections* / prevention & control, HIV-1* / immunology, Humans, Immunization, Secondary, Immunogenicity, Vaccine, Male, Middle Aged, United States, Vaccines, DNA* / administration & dosage, Vaccines, DNA* / adverse effects, Vaccines, DNA* / immunology, Young Adult",GLA-SE,PMID_38692824,"AIDS Vaccines, Vaccines, DNA, HIV Antibodies, HIV Envelope Protein gp120, Antibodies, Neutralizing","Title: Safety and immunogenicity of a polyvalent DNA-protein HIV vaccine with matched Env immunogens delivered as a prime-boost regimen or coadministered in HIV-uninfected adults in the USA (HVTN 124): a phase 1, placebo-controlled, double-blind randomised controlled trial.

On the following 4 days they received equal amounts of unlabelled lysine. The eggs laid during the 8 days of the experiment were separated into the white of egg, the yolk and the eggshell, and the to and heavy nitrogen in the individual fractions were determined.
