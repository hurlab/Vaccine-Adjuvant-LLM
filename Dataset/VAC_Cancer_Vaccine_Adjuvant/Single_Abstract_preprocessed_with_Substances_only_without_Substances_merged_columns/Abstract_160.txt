Abstract: Diarrheal diseases are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. They are most prevalent in settings with inadequate sanitation, poor hygiene and contaminated water. An important diarrheal pathogen in such settings isShigella. No commercially available vaccine exists against shigellosis and immunity to the pathogen is serotype-restricted. We have previously shown that a polypeptide fusion of the Type Three Secretion Apparatus (T3SA) proteins IpaB and IpaD (named DBF) was efficacious as a vaccine againstShigella. Vaccination using different administration routes indicated that protection conferred by DBF did not fully correlate with antibodies. To define the immune responses involved in protection, we studied cellular responses to intranasal immunization with the DBF and the adjuvant dmLT. We found dendritic cell (DC) activation at the nasal associated lymphoid tissue (NALT). Activation markers CD86 and MHCII significantly increase in cells from immunized mice. Antigen exposurein vitrofurther confirmed the upregulation of CD80 and CD40 in primary dendritic cells. Animals immunized with antigen-primed dendritic cells were protected againstShigellainfection, at levels comparable to the efficacy of immunization with the protein vaccine formulation. Therefore, we show that antigen-primed DCs are enough to provide immunity, and propose a mechanism of protection againstShigellaspp. based on DC-mediated antigen presentation to T cells.Keywords:Shigella; dendritic cell; dmLT; fusion protein; vaccine.
