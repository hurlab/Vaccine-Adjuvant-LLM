PMID_36578488	Title: Potentiating pneumococcal glycoconjugate vaccine PCV13 with saponin adjuvant VSA-1. Abstract: VSA-1 is a semisynthetic saponin adjuvant prepared from naturally occurringMomordicasaponin and capable of stimulating antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses. Its immunostimulating activity in enhancing the immune responses induced by the clinical glycoconjugate pneumococcal vaccine PCV13 is compared with QS-21 in female BALB/c mice. Both VSA-1 and QS-21 boosted IgG and opsonic antibodies titers against seven selected serotypes, including serotypes 3, 14, and 19A that are involved in most PCV13 breakthroughs. Since VSA-1 is much more accessible and of lower toxicity than QS-21, it can be a practical saponin immunostimulant to be included in a new glycoconjugate pneumococcal vaccine formulation.Keywords:Momordica saponin; VSA-1; adjuvant; immunostimulant; pneumococcal vaccine.
