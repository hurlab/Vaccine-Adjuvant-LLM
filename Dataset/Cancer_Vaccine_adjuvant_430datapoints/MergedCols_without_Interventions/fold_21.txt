NCT Number	Study Summary
NCT00140738	Study Title: Safety and Immunogenicity Study of the New dHER2 Vaccine to Treat HER2-positive Metastatic Breast Cancer. Brief Summary: Patients will receive a maximum of 18 injections of dHER2 vaccine in a treatment schedule that will last for up to about a year, and thereafter there will be a follow-up period of about one more year.
NCT04713514	Study Title: OSE2101 Alone or in Combination With Pembrolizumab vs BSC in Patient With Platinum-sensitive Recurrent OC. Brief Summary: The proposed study is an international randomized phase II, multicenter, open-label, three arms trial to assess best supportive care (BSC) vs OSE2101 and vs OSE2101 + pembrolizumab as maintenance treatment for patients with platinum sensitive relapsed ovarian cancers, previously treated with chemotherapy (regardless of the number of prior lines of platinum-based chemotherapy), bevacizumab (if eligible) and a PARP inhibitor (if eligible). Patients in Complete Response, Partial Response, or Stable Disease at the end of chemotherapy with at least 4 cycles of platinum based chemotherapy will be randomized in one of the three arms (randomization 1:1:2). They will receive one or the two study treatments or BSC until progression, or intolerance, or up to 2 years (from 1st study treatment dose).
NCT05045755	Study Title: The Durability of Protection and Immuno-persistence Study of a Recombinant HPV 16/18 Bivalent Vaccine in Female. Brief Summary: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the durability of protection and immuno-persistence of Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Bivalent (Types 16,18) Vaccine administered in females aged 18-45 years.
NCT00145158	Study Title: Immunization With 8 Peptides Mixed With CpG 7909 or Montanide ISA51 in Patients With Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma. Brief Summary: The purposes of this study are to describe the immune response to individual peptides after immunization with a combination of 8 peptides and CpG 7909 or Montanide ISA51; to determine the safety of the vaccines and; to document the tumor response in patients receiving the vaccines.
NCT01970358	"Study Title: A Phase I Study With a Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine in Melanoma. Brief Summary: This research study is evaluating a new type of melanoma vaccine called ""Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine"". The purpose of this study is to determine if it is possible to make and administer safely a vaccine against melanoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of the participant's own melanoma. It is known that melanomas have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the participant's body fight any tumor cells that could cause the melanoma to come back in the future. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune response."
NCT00028496	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy With or Without Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Advanced or Metastatic Cancer. Brief Summary: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without sargramostim in treating patients who have advanced or metastatic cancer. Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim may make tumor cells more sensitive to the vaccine and may kill more tumor cells.
NCT00204516	Study Title: Vaccination With Tumor mRNA in Metastatic Melanoma - Fixed Combination Versus Individual Selection of Targeted Antigens. Brief Summary: The purpose of the vaccination protocol is to induce specific immune responses against melanoma associated antigens by intradermal injections of mRNA coding for the corresponding antigen.
NCT03400917	Study Title: Autologous Dendritic Cells Loaded With Autologous Tumor Associated Antigens for Treatment of Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma. Brief Summary: This is a single-arm, open-label phase II clinical trial in which approximately 55 patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM) will be enrolled with the intent to receive an autologous dendritic cell vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic cells loaded with autologous tumor-associated antigens (AV-GBM-1).
NCT00727441	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy With or Without Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients Undergoing Chemotherapy and Radiation Therapy for Stage I or Stage II Pancreatic Cancer That Can Be Removed by Surgery. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill pancreatic cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving vaccine therapy together with cyclophosphamide may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether vaccine therapy is more effective with or without cyclophosphamide in treating patients with pancreatic cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy and to see how well it works when given with or without cyclophosphamide in treating patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation therapy for stage I or stage II pancreatic cancer that can be removed by surgery.
NCT00005841	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from melanoma cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Vaccine therapy plus filgrastim combined with a specific protein may be a more effective treatment for melanoma. PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that has been completely removed during surgery.
