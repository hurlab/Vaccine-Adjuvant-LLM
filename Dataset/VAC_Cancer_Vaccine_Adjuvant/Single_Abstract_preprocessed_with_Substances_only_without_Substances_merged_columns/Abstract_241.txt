Abstract: Influenza virus infects the host and transmits through the respiratory tract (i.e., the mouth and nose); therefore, the development of intranasal influenza vaccines that mimic the natural infection, coupled with an efficient mucosal adjuvant, is an attractive alternative to current parenteral vaccines. However, with the withdrawal of cholera toxin and Escherichia coli heat-labile endotoxin from clinical use due to side effects, there are no approved adjuvants for intranasal vaccines. Therefore, safe and effective mucosal adjuvants are urgently needed. Previously, we reported that one derivative of α-Galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), 7DW8-5, could enhance the protective efficacy of split influenza vaccine by injection administration. However, the mucosal adjuvanticity of 7DW8-5 is still unclear. In this study, we found that 7DW8-5 promotes the production of secret IgA antibodies and IgG antibodies and enhances the protective efficacy of the split influenza vaccine by intranasal administration. Furthermore, co-administration of 7DW8-5 with the split influenza vaccine significantly reduces the virus shedding in the upper and lower respiratory tract after lethal challenge. Our results demonstrate that 7DW8-5 is a novel mucosal adjuvant for the split influenza vaccine.Keywords:7DW8-5; glycolipid; influenza vaccine; mucosal adjuvant.
