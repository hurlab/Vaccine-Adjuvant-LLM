NCT01479244,Efficacy and Safety Study of NeuVax™ (Nelipepimut-S or E75) Vaccine to Prevent Breast Cancer Recurrence,"Purpose of this trial:

1. To assess the efficacy and safety of NeuVax™ administered with adjuvant Leukine® (sargramostim, GM-CSF).
2. To evaluate and compare the disease free survival (DFS) in the vaccinated and control subjects.",Breast Cancer With Low to Intermediate HER2 Expression,"BIOLOGICAL: NeuVax™ vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: Leukine® (sargramostim, GM-CSF) and water for injection",GM-CSF
NCT00019006,"Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Colon, Pancreatic, or Lung Cancer","RATIONALE: Vaccines made from mutated ras peptides may make the body build an immune response to and kill tumor cells.

PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of a vaccine containing mutated ras peptides and an immune adjuvant in treating patients who have colon, pancreatic, or lung cancer.",Recurrent Colon Cancer|Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer|Stage III Pancreatic Cancer|Stage III Rectal Cancer|Limited Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer|Recurrent Pancreatic Cancer|Recurrent Rectal Cancer|Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Stage I Pancreatic Cancer|Stage II Non-small Cell Lung Cancer|Stage IVB Pancreatic Cancer|Stage II Pancreatic Cancer|Stage III Colon Cancer|Stage IVA Pancreatic Cancer,DRUG: Detox-B adjuvant|DRUG: ras peptide cancer vaccine,Detox-B adjuvant
NCT00398138,"Vaccine Therapy and GM-CSF in Treating Patients With Acute Myeloid Leukemia, Myelodysplastic Syndromes, Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer, or Mesothelioma","RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Biological therapies, such as GM-CSF, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving vaccine therapy together with GM-CSF may kill more cancer cells.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy and GM-CSF in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, non-small cell lung cancer, or mesothelioma.",Leukemia|Lung Cancer|Malignant Mesothelioma|Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Primary Peritoneal Cavity Cancer,BIOLOGICAL: WT-1 analog peptide vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: incomplete Freund's adjuvant|BIOLOGICAL: sargramostim|GENETIC: polymerase chain reaction|OTHER: flow cytometry|OTHER: immunoenzyme technique,Incomplete Freund's adjuvant
