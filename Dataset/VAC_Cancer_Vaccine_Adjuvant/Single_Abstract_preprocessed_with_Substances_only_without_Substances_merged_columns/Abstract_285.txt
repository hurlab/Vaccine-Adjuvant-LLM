Abstract: Background:The aim of the current study was to determine the safety and immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) alone or formulated with Advax delta inulin adjuvant in those who were older (aged >60 years) or had chronic disease.Methods:Over 4 consecutive years from 2008 through 2011, adult participants with chronic disease or >60 years of age were recruited into a randomized controlled study to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of Advax-adjuvanted TIV (TIV + Adj) versus standard TIV. The per-protocol population with â‰¥1 postbaseline measurement of influenza antibodies comprised 1297 participants, 447 in the TIV and 850 in the TIV + Adj) group.Results:No safety issues were identified. Variables negatively affecting vaccine responses included obesity and diabetes mellitus. Advax adjuvant had a positive impact on anti-influenza immunoglobulin M responses and on H3N2 and B strain seropositivity as assessed by hemagglutination inhibition.Conclusions:TIV + Adj was safe and well tolerated in individuals with chronic disease. There is an ongoing need for research into improved influenza vaccines for high-risk populations.Clinical trials registration:Australia New Zealand Clinical Trial Registry: ACTRN 12608000364370.Keywords:Advax; adjuvant; chronic disease; influenza; vaccine.
