Abstract: The tuberculin skin test (TST) is a simple and inexpensive test to determine whether individuals have been exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This test is not always reliable, however, in people previously immunized with BCG and/or who have been exposed to environmental mycobacterial species due to a reaction to purified protein derivative (PPD) used in the skin test. An issue with BCG, therefore, is that the resulting sensitization to PPD in some individuals compromises the diagnostic use of the skin test. The ability to induce protective immune responses without sensitizing to the tuberculin skin test will be important properties of next-generation tuberculosis (TB) vaccine candidates. We show here that guinea pigs immunized with the candidate TB vaccine ID93/GLA-SE, currently in clinical trials, do not react to intradermal PPD administration. In contrast, positive DTH responses to both ID93 and components thereof were induced in ID93/GLA-SE-immunized animals, indicating robust but specific cellular responses were present in the immunized animals. Noninterference with the TST is an important factor for consideration in the development of a vaccine against M. tuberculosis. Substances: Tuberculin, Tuberculosis Vaccines
