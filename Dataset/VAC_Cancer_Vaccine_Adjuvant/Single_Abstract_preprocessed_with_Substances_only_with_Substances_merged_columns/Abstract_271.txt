Abstract: Infections with SARS-CoV-2 variants and declining immunity after primary vaccination, encouraged the use of booster doses. Some countries changed their immunization programmes to boost with vaccines different from the ones in their original schedule, based on results from immunogenicity and effectiveness studies. This study reports immunological analysis of samples collected in a phase 4 randomized trial, where participants who had previously received two primary doses of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 (ChAd) or inactivated BBV152 vaccine were randomized to receive either ChAd or BBV152 booster and further categorized as: Group 1 (two primary doses of ChAd - ChAd booster), Group 2 (two primary doses of ChAd - BBV152 booster), Group 3 (two primary doses of BBV152 - ChAd booster), and Group 4 (two primary doses of BBV152 - BBV152 booster). SARS-CoV-2 specific cellular and humoral responses at day 0 (pre-boost samples 12-36 weeks after the second primary dose), and at day 28 post booster, were measured in a subset of participants (ChAd recipients, n = 37 and BBV152 recipients, n = 36). Additionally, on day180 post-booster humoral responses were assessed for the entire cohort (N = 378). Primary vaccination with 2 doses of BBV152 generated higher memory-B cells (median% 0.41 vs 0.35) and cytokine producing CD8-Tcells (median% 0.09 vs 0.04) while lower anti-spike IgG levels (medianAU/ml: 12,433 vs 27,074) as compared to ChAd. Irrespective of the primary vaccine received, ChAd boosted individuals generated higher memory-B cell frequencies and anti-spike IgG levels as compared to BBV152 booster. The percentage ACE-2 inhibition against Omicron and its sub-variants was higher in Group 3 (median > 60 %) as compared to other groups (median < 25 %). At day180 post booster the hierarchy of the antibody amounts was Group 1 ∼ Group 2 ∼ Group 3 > Group 4. Sustained humoral and robust cellular immune response to SARS-CoV-2 can be obtained with ChAd booster irrespective of the primary vaccination regimen. The trial is registered with ISRTCN (CTRI/2021/08/035648).Keywords:Antibodies; Cellular memory; Neutralization of variant; Response decay; SARS-Cov-2; Vaccines.
