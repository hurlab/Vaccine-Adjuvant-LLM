Abstract: There are no licensed vaccines forShigella, a leading cause of children's diarrhea and a common etiology of travelers' diarrhea. To develop a cross-protectiveShigellavaccine, in this study, we constructed a polyvalent protein immunogen to present conserved immunodominant epitopes ofShigellainvasion plasmid antigens B (IpaB) and D (IpaD), VirG, GuaB, and Shiga toxins on backbone protein IpaD, by applying an epitope- and structure-based multiepitope-fusion-antigen (MEFA) vaccinology platform, examined protein (ShigellaMEFA) broad immunogenicity, and evaluated antibody function againstShigellainvasion and Shiga toxin cytotoxicity but also protection againstShigellalethal challenge. Mice intramuscularly immunized withShigellaMEFA protein developed IgG responses to IpaB, IpaD, VirG, GuaB, and Shiga toxins 1 and 2; mouse sera significantly reduced invasion ofShigella sonnei,Shigella flexneriserotype 2a, 3a, or 6,Shigella boydii,andShigella dysenteriaetype 1 and neutralized cytotoxicity of Shiga toxins ofShigellaand Shiga toxin-producingEscherichia coli in vitro. Moreover, mice intranasally immunized withShigellaMEFA protein (adjuvanted with dmLT) developed antigen-specific serum IgG, lung IgG and IgA, and fecal IgA antibodies, and survived from lethal pulmonary challenge withS. sonneiorS. flexneriserotype 2a, 3a, or 6. In contrast, the control mice died, became unresponsive, or lost 20% of body weight in 48 h. These results indicated that thisShigellaMEFA protein is broadly immunogenic, induces broadly functional antibodies, and cross-protects against lethal pulmonary challenges withS. sonneiorS. flexneriserotypes, suggesting a potential application of this polyvalent MEFA protein inShigellavaccine development.Keywords:MEFA (multiepitope fusion antigen); Shigella; broad immunogenicity; cross-protection; lethal pulmonary challenge; multivalent vaccine; polyvalent immunogen.
