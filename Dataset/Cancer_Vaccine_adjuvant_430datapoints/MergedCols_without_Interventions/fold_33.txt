NCT Number	Study Summary
NCT05794659	Study Title: Adjuvant Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine (AST-201, pUMVC3-hIGFBP-2) in Patients With Advanced Ovarian Cancer. Brief Summary: The purpose of this phase 2 study is to assess the efficacy and safety for adjuvant therapeutic cancer vaccine AST-201 (pUMVC3-hIGFBP-2) in patients with newly diagnosed homologous-recombination proficient(HRP) advanced ovarian cancer (Stage III) after debulking surgery. Patients will receive AST-201 with rhuGM-CSF(Colony Stimulating Factor) or placebo with rhuGM-CSF in combination with standard adjuvant chemotherapy(Paclitaxel/Carboplatin).
NCT00023842	Study Title: BCG With or Without Mitomycin in Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as BCG use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known if BCG is more effective with or without mitomycin. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of BCG plus mitomycin with that of BCG alone in treating patients who have bladder cancer.
NCT03012100	Study Title: Multi-epitope Folate Receptor Alpha Peptide Vaccine, GM-CSF, and Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Brief Summary: This randomized phase II trial studies how well multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and cyclophosphamide work to prevent the recurrence of stage 1-3 triple negative breast cancer. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and cyclophosphamide may work well together to prevent cancer recurrence after surgery and other standard treatments for triple negative breast cancer.
NCT00005052	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Primary Stage II Melanoma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether vaccine therapy is more effective than observation alone for melanoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying vaccine therapy to see how well it works compared to observation alone in treating patients with primary stage II melanoma.
NCT01909752	Study Title: Combination Vaccine Immunotherapy (DRibbles) for Patients With Definitively-Treated Stage III Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. Brief Summary: This study will test an investigational vaccine, called DRibbles, for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We hypothesize that vaccination with the DRibble vaccine will cause an immune responses against proteins contained in the DRibble vaccine and the protein antigens targeted by this strong immune response will include common antigens shared by both the vaccine and the patient's tumor.
NCT00821652	Study Title: Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo-controlled Topical Resiquimod Adjuvant for NY-ESO-1 Protein Vaccination. Brief Summary: The study is designed to see if a course of injections containing the NY-ESO-1 protein (a tumor antigen, marker expressed by tumors); in combination with an immune stimulant (adjuvant) Montanide, with or without resiquimod (another adjuvant) is well tolerated and safe in patients with surgically resected Stage IIB, IIC, Stage III or Stage IV (AJCC criteria) melanoma, a tumor that expresses NY-ESO-1. In addition, this study is designed to see if the patient's body's defense (immune) system can be boosted (strengthened) by this vaccine and if the addition of resiquimod to the vaccine makes this more likely.
NCT01827137	"Study Title: WT1 Analog Peptide Vaccine in Patients With Multiple Myeloma Following Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation. Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to see if the investigator can help the immune system to work against myeloma through the use/administration of a peptide vaccine (immunotherapy agent) directed against the Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) protein called galinpepimut-S (or GPS, for brief). Because cancer is produced by the patient's own body, the immune system does not easily recognize and fight cancer cells. The immune system needs to be ""trained"" to do this; the latter goal is accomplished by using a vaccine consisting of selected fragments of the target antigen, in this case, WT1. This disease has been selected for this study because the WT1 protein is often present in myeloma cells. WT1 is a gene that is involved in the normal development of kidneys and other organs. When the WT1 gene becomes abnormal, it can make proteins involved in the development of cancer, i.e., can acquire the properties of a true ""oncogene"". This study will determine whether the vaccine against the WT1 antigen (present in malignant plasmacytes) can cause an immune response which is safe, but also able to keep the myeloma from either coming back or progressing."
NCT04267237	Study Title: A Study of the Efficacy and Safety of RO7198457 in Combination With Atezolizumab Versus Atezolizumab Alone Following Adjuvant Platinum-Doublet Chemotherapy in Participants Who Are ctDNA Positive After Surgical Resection of Stage II-III Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Brief Summary: This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and biomarkers of RO7198457 plus atezolizumab compared with atezolizumab alone in patients with Stage II-III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who are circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) positive following surgical resection and have received standard-of-care adjuvant platinum-doublet chemotherapy.
NCT03562637	Study Title: Study of Adagloxad Simolenin (OBI-822)/OBI-821 in the Adjuvant Treatment of Patients With Globo H Positive TNBC. Brief Summary: The GLORIA study is a Phase III, randomized, open-label study to prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of adagloxad simolenin (OBI 822)/OBI-821 in the adjuvant treatment of patients with high risk, early stage Globo-H Positive TNBC.
NCT00072137	Study Title: Neoadjuvant Intravesical Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Bladder Carcinoma Who Are Undergoing Cystectomy. Brief Summary: This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy given directly into the bladder in treating patients who are undergoing surgery to remove all or part of the bladder. Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving a vaccine directly into the bladder before surgery may cause a stronger immune response and keep tumor cells from coming back after surgery.
