NCT Number	Study Summary
NCT03673020	Study Title: Phase 1a Study to Evaluate Immunogenicity of ASV. Brief Summary: This is an open-label Phase 1a First-in-Human Study to determine Safety and Tolerability of ASV AGEN2017 with QS-21 Stimulon Adjuvant as a Single Agent in Subjects With Tumors at Risk of Relapse Undergoing Observation as Standard of Care Following Complete Surgical Resection.
NCT00007826	Study Title: Monoclonal Antibody Therapy and/or Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic Colorectal Cancer. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Vaccines made from cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill colorectal tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy and/or vaccine therapy in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer.
NCT00058526	Study Title: A Dose-escalation Vaccine Trial in HER2-overexpressing Patients With High-risk Breast Cancer. Brief Summary: Treatment phase: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the immune response elicited by a new anti-cancer therapy in patients with breast cancer in remission but who are at high risk of relapse. The study product is an immunotherapeutic consisting of the recombinant dHER2 protein combined with an immunostimulant called AS15. The study aims to determine the optimal of three different dose levels of dHER2 combined with the same fixed dose of AS15 by assessing the safety and the immune response elicited after a series of injections of the study product. Five-year follow-up phase: This part of the study aims to assess any late onset toxicity of the study treatment through yearly follow-up visits and to monitor the patients' survival and disease status up to five years after the last administration of the study treatment. The patients' immune response is also measured to assess the robustness of the immune response elicited by the study treatment.
NCT00559026	Study Title: Phase I/II Study of Chemo-Immunotherapy Combination in Melanoma Patients. Brief Summary: This phase I/II study is directed at evaluating safety and immunogenicity of a melanoma peptide vaccine in combination or not with Dacarbazine administration in melanoma patients.
NCT02818426	Study Title: Universal Cancer Peptide-based Vaccination in Metastatic NSCLC. Brief Summary: UCPVAx is a therapeutic vaccine based on the telomerase-derived UCP designed to induce strong TH1 CD4 T cell responses in cancer patients. Three doses of UCPVax (0,25 mg, 0,5 mg and 1 mg) will be tested in this phase I/II study by using Continuous Reassessment Method (CRML) dose escalation design model. The phase I is a dose escalation study designed to evaluate safety of use of UCPVax and to estimate its Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). The phase II is a dose deescalation designed to evaluate the immunogenicity of UCPVax according to the dose level.
NCT05672966	Study Title: Phase I Clinical Trial of a Candidate HPV Vaccine. Brief Summary: This is a Phase I, first-in-human, randomized, observer-blinded, placebo-controlled, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of BV601 (a HPV Vaccine) in healthy adult volunteers.
NCT05456165	Study Title: Study of an Individualized Vaccine Targeting Neoantigens in Combination With Immune Checkpoint Blockade for Patients With Colon Cancer. Brief Summary: The primary objective is to assess and characterize the antitumor activity and safety and tolerability of adjuvant treatment with an individualized neoantigen vaccine called GRT-C901/GRT-R902 (chimpanzee adenovirus \[ChAd\] and self-amplifying messenger RNA \[samRNA\] vectors), in combination with checkpoint inhibitors. Antitumor activity will be based on molecular response in patients with colon cancer who have circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) following surgical resection.
NCT00616720	Study Title: Interferon-gamma or Aldesleukin and Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as interferon-gamma and aldesleukin, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Giving biological therapy together with vaccine therapy may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving aldesleukin or interferon gamma together with vaccine therapy works in treating patients with multiple myeloma.
NCT04180774	Study Title: Safety and Efficacy of Tag-7 Gene-modified Vaccine in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Malignant Melanoma or Kidney Cancer. Brief Summary: This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of inactivated tumor cells genetically modified with the TAG-7 gene as immunotherapy for cancer. Patients with melanoma or kidney cancer were included since they have immune-dependent tumors. Treatment was done in the adjuvant setting after complete cytoreduction of locally advanced or metastatic disease or in the therapeutic setting in patients where complete cytoreduction was impossible.
NCT03645148	"Study Title: Clinical Study of a Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer. Brief Summary: This research study is evaluating a new type of pancreatic cancer vaccine called ""Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine"" as a possible treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. The purpose of the clinical study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and partial efficacy of the personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine in the treatment of Chinese patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, so as to provide a new personalized therapeutic strategy for advanced pancreatic cancer patients. It is known that cancer patients have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the participant's body fight any tumor cells that could cause the cancer to come back in the future. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune response."
