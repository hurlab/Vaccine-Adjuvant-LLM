Abstract: The use of inactivated poliovirus vaccines (IPV) will be required to achieve, world-wide eradication of polio. The current expense of IPV is however prohibitive for, some countries, and therefore efforts to decrease the costs of the vaccine are a high, priority. Our results show that the addition of oil-in-water emulsion adjuvants to an, inactivated trivalent poliovirus vaccine are dose-sparing and are capable of enhancing, neutralizing antibody titers in the rat potency model. Substances: Adjuvants, Immunologic, Antibodies, Neutralizing, Antibodies, Viral, Emulsions, Oils, Poliovirus Vaccines, Vaccines, Inactivated, Water
