Non-living tuberculosis (TB) vaccine candidates may not only be safer than the current vaccine (BCG) but could also be used to boost BCG to enhance or elongate protection. No subunit vaccines, however, are currently available for TB. To address this gap and to improve the global TB situation, we have generated a defined subunit vaccine by genetically fusing the genes of 3 potent protein Mtb antigens, Rv2875, Rv3478 and Rv1886, into a single product: ID87. When delivered with a TLR4 agonist-based adjuvant, GLA-SE, ID87 immunization reduced Mtb burden in the lungs of experimentally infected mice. The reduction in bacterial burden of ID87/GLA-SE immunized mice was accompanied by an early and significant leukocyte infiltration into the lungs during the infectious process. ID87/GLA-SE appears to be a promising new vaccine candidate that warrants further development.
