Abstract: Background:Determining the efficacy of human vaccines that induce antigen-specific protective CD4 T cell responses against pathogens can be particularly challenging to evaluate. Surface expression of CD11a and CD49d has been shown to identify antigen-specific CD4 T cells against viral pathogens in mice. We hypothesized that CD11a and CD49d would also serve as markers of human antigen-specific T cells responding to vaccination.Methods:A phase I vaccine trial enabled us to evaluate a novel gating strategy based on surface expression of CD11a and CD49d as a means of detecting antigen-specific, cytokine producing CD4 and CD8 T cells induced after vaccination of naïve individuals against leishmaniasis. Three study groups received LEISH-F3 recombinant protein combined with either squalene oil-in-water emulsion (SE) alone, SE with the synthetic TLR-4 ligand glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (GLA-SE), or SE with Salmonella minnesota-derived monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL-SE). Individuals were given 3 vaccine doses, on days 0, 28 and 168.Results:Starting after the first vaccine dose, the frequency of both CD11ahiCD49d+CD4 and CD11ahiCD49d+CD8 T cells significantly increased over time throughout the 24-week trial. To confirm the role of CD11ahiCD49d+expression in the identification of the antigen-specific T cells, cytokine production was measured following LEISH-F3 stimulation. All of the IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 producing cells were found within the CD11ahiCD49d+population.Conclusions:Our results suggest that the change in the frequency of CD11ahiCD49d+T cells can be used to track antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses following T cell-targeted vaccination.Keywords:Activation markers; Adjuvant; Protective immunity; T cell response; Visceral leishmaniasis.
