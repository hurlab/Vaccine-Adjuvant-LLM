PMID_23306367	Title: A novel hepatitis B vaccine containing Advax™, a polysaccharide adjuvant derived from delta inulin, induces robust humoral and cellular immunity with minimal reactogenicity in preclinical testing. Abstract: Although current HBV vaccines have an outstanding record of safety and efficacy, reduced immunogenicity is a problem in those of older age, or having renal impairment or diabetes mellitus. In this study, we tested the ability of Advax™ adjuvant, a novel polysaccharide adjuvant based on delta inulin, to enhance the immunogenicity of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBs) in mice and guinea pigs by comparison to the traditional alum adjuvant. Advax™ provided antigen-sparing, significantly enhanced both anti-HBs antibody titers, and anti-HBs CD4 and CD8 T-cells, with increases in Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokine responses. Unlike alum, the adjuvant effect of Advax™ was seen even when injected 24h before the HBs antigen. Advax™ adjuvant similarly enhanced humoral and cellular immune responses in guinea pigs to a third generation preS-HBs antigen. Advax™ adjuvant when combined with HBs antigen could provide enhanced protection over current generation HBV vaccines for immunization of low responder populations.
