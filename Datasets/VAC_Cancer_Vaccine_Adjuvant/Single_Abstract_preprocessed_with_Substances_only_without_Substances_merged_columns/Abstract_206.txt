Abstract: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) commonly causes severe respiratory tract infections in infants, peaking between 2 and 6 months of age; an age at which direct vaccination is unlikely to be effective. Maternal immunization can deliver high levels of antibodies to newborns, providing immediate protection. Following natural infection, antibodies targeting the prefusion conformation of RSV F protein (PreF) have the greatest neutralizing capacity and thus, may provide infants with a high degree of RSV protection when acquired through maternal vaccination. However, the influence of anti-PreF maternal antibodies on infant immunity following RSV exposure has not been elucidated. To address this knowledge gap, offspring born to dams immunized with a RSV PreF vaccine formulation were challenged with RSV and their immune responses were analyzed over time. These studies demonstrated safety and efficacy for RSV-challenged, maternally-immunized offspring but high and waning maternal antibody levels were associated with differential innate and T cell immunity.Keywords:Antibody; Immunity; Infant; Maternal; Offspring; PreF; RSV.
