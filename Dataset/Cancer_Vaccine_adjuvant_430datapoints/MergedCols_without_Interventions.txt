NCT00086866	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed With Surgery. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying two different regimens of vaccine therapy and comparing them to see how well they work in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed with surgery.
NCT02334865	Study Title: SVN53-67/M57-KLH Peptide Vaccine in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma Receiving Lenalidomide Maintenance Therapy. Brief Summary: This phase I trial studies the safety of SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant together with sargramostim in treating patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who are receiving lenalidomide maintenance therapy. Vaccines made from survivin peptide may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells that express survivin. Incomplete Freund's adjuvant may help stimulate the body's immune response to a vaccine treatment. Colony-stimulating factors, such as sargramostim, may increase the production of blood cells. Lenalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine in incomplete Freund's adjuvant and sargramostim before or after the start of lenalidomide maintenance therapy may be a better treatment for multiple myeloma.

All eligible patients will receive NEO-PV-01 + adjuvant and nivolumab while on this trial.
NCT06202066	Study Title: Temozolomide and Survivin Long Peptide Vaccine (SurVaxM) for the Treatment of Patients With Progressing Metastatic Neuroendocrine Tumors. Brief Summary: This phase II trial compares the safety and effect of temozolomide combined with survivin long peptide vaccine (SurVaxM) to temozolomide alone in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET) that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic) and is growing, spreading or getting worse (progressing). Temozolomide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid and may kill tumor cells and slow down or stop tumor growth. Survivin, a protein, is expressed in 50% of patients that have neuroendocrine tumors and, is associated with poor outcomes. SVN53-67/M57-KLH peptide vaccine (SurVaxM) is a vaccine that has been shown to produce an immune system response against cancer cells that express a survivin and may block the growth of new tumor cells. Giving temozolomide with SurVaxM may kill more tumor cells in patients with progressing metastatic neuroendocrine tumors.
NCT00203866	Study Title: Trial of G250 Peptide and IL-2 Following Surgical Resection of Locally Advanced/Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.

NCT01505166	Study Title: Randomized Phase II Adjuvant Chemotherapy Â± FANG in Colorectal Carcinoma With Liver Metastases. Brief Summary: Preliminary studies with a variety of vaccines suggest target accessibility (potential immunogenicity) in a variety of solid tumors to immune directed approaches. In an effort to overcome limitations of immunostimulatory cancer vaccines, Gradalis has designed a novel autologous vaccine to address inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens, antigen recognition by the immune system (i.e. antigen--\>immunogen), effector potency, and cancer-induced resistance. In an effort to overcome limitations of immunostimulatory cancer vaccines, we designed a novel dual-modulatory autologous whole cell vaccine, Vigil, incorporating the rhGMCSF transgene and the bifunctional shRNAfurin (to block proprotein conversion to active TGFb1 and b2) to 1) address the inability to fully identify cancer associated antigens, 2) effect antigen recognition by the immune system, 3) enhance effector potency, and 4) subvert endogenous cancer-induced immune resistance. We have also completed the Phase I assessment of Vigil vaccine in 30 advanced solid tumor patients (1.0 x 10\^7 cells/injection/month for a maximum of 12 vaccinations) who have not experienced any significant adverse effects following 144 vaccinations, including 6 patients with colorectal carcinoma. Plasmid functionality, immune biomarker response, and preliminary evidence of anticancer activity have been observed. This is a two-part Phase II study of the Vigil autologous vaccine. Six patients will be enrolled into the Part 1 of the study to receive intradermal autologous Vigil cancer vaccine (1.0 x 10\^7 cells/injection; maximum of 12 vaccinations). Part 2 of the study will be a randomized Phase II study of sandwich or adjuvant chemotherapy and intradermal autologous Vigil cancer vaccine (1.0 x 10\^7 cells/injection; maximum of 12 vaccinations) versus sandwich or adjuvant chemotherapy and placebo in patients with colorectal carcinoma with either synchronous or metachronous liver metastases (CLM +/= pulmonary metastases) following resection +/= ablation with curative intent.Sandwich therapy indicates a combination of both pre-operative and postoperative chemotherapy as opposed to neo-adjuvant (all chemotherapy prior to surgery) or adjuvant (all chemotherapy following surgery) therapy. A minimum harvest aliquot to produce 4 monthly injections will be required for entry into the study. Patients in whom insufficient tissue (\<4 doses) is collected or whose vaccine fails manufacturing release criteria will not receive vaccine.

NCT00616720	Study Title: Interferon-gamma or Aldesleukin and Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as interferon-gamma and aldesleukin, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Giving biological therapy together with vaccine therapy may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving aldesleukin or interferon gamma together with vaccine therapy works in treating patients with multiple myeloma.
NCT04180774	Study Title: Safety and Efficacy of Tag-7 Gene-modified Vaccine in Locally Advanced or Metastatic Malignant Melanoma or Kidney Cancer. Brief Summary: This study was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of inactivated tumor cells genetically modified with the TAG-7 gene as immunotherapy for cancer. Patients with melanoma or kidney cancer were included since they have immune-dependent tumors. Treatment was done in the adjuvant setting after complete cytoreduction of locally advanced or metastatic disease or in the therapeutic setting in patients where complete cytoreduction was impossible.
NCT03645148	"Study Title: Clinical Study of a Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine in Treating Patients With Advanced Pancreatic Cancer. Brief Summary: This research study is evaluating a new type of pancreatic cancer vaccine called ""Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine"" as a possible treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer. The purpose of the clinical study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and partial efficacy of the personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine in the treatment of Chinese patients with advanced pancreatic cancer, so as to provide a new personalized therapeutic strategy for advanced pancreatic cancer patients. It is known that cancer patients have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the participant's body fight any tumor cells that could cause the cancer to come back in the future. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune response."
NCT02944357	Study Title: Gemcitabine Hydrochloride, Cisplatin, and AGS-003-BLD in Treating Patients With Muscle-Invasive Bladder Cancer Undergoing Surgery. Brief Summary: This pilot clinical trial studies how well gemcitabine hydrochloride, cisplatin, and AGS-003-BLD work in treating patients with bladder cancer that has spread to the muscle and who are undergoing surgery. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Vaccines made from a person's tumor cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving gemcitabine hydrochloride, cisplatin, and AGS-003-BLD before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be removed by surgery.
NCT00079157	Study Title: Vaccine Plus Montanide ISA-51 and Sargramostim in Treating Patients With Stage IV Breast Cancer.

PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy when given together with Montanide ISA-51 and sargramostim in treating patients with stage IV breast cancer.
NCT02151448	Study Title: Î±DC1 Vaccine + Chemokine Modulatory Regimen (CKM) as Adjuvant Treatment of Peritoneal Surface Malignancies. Brief Summary: This trial is to determine the safest dose of a triple combination (chemokine modulatory regimen or CKM) of celecoxib, interferon alfa (IFN), and rintatolimod that can be given with a DC vaccine as treatment of peritoneal surface malignancies after standard of care surgery. The first phase of this study will determine the safest dose of IFN that can be given in combination with celecoxib and rintatolimod along with a DC vaccine. The doses of celecoxib (400 mg) and rintatolimod (200 mg) will be consistent while the dose of IFN will be increased (5, 10, or 20 MU/m2) as participants are enrolled to the trial. The high dose of IFN in combination with celecoxib and rintatolimod will be used for the next phase of the clinical trial. After surgery, participants will receive 2 cycles of the investigational treatment. The second phase of this study will test if the investigational treatment has any effects on peritoneal surface malignancies. The doses of the combination determined in the first phase will be used in this phase of the clinical trial. After surgery, participants will receive 2 cycles of the investigational treatment, followed by standard chemotherapy as determined by their oncologist, and then 2 more cycles of the investigational treatment.
NCT02455557	Study Title: SurVaxM Vaccine Therapy and Temozolomide in Treating Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma. Brief Summary: This phase II trial studies the side effects and how well vaccine therapy works when given together with temozolomide in treating patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Vaccines made from the survivin peptide or antigen may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells that express survivin. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether temozolomide is more effective with or without vaccine therapy in treating glioblastoma.
NCT02649582	Study Title: Adjuvant Dendritic Cell-immunotherapy Plus Temozolomide in Glioblastoma Patients.

NCT00118274	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy With or Without Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery for Stage II, Stage III, or Stage IV Melanoma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Cyclophosphamide may also stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Giving vaccine therapy together with cyclophosphamide after surgery may cause a stronger immune response to kill any remaining tumor cells. It may also prevent or delay the recurrence of melanoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of vaccine therapy when given with or without cyclophosphamide and to see how well they work in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage II, stage III, or stage IV melanoma.
NCT00003274	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage II Melanoma That Can Be Removed by Surgery.

NCT00597272	Study Title: Determine Toxicity and Antibody Responses With a KLH Conjugated Bivalent Vaccine Containing GD2 Lactone, GD3 Lactone With Immunological Adjuvant QS-DG or OPT-821 in Patients With Disease Free AJCC Stage III or IV Cutaneous Melanoma. Brief Summary: Vaccines contain substances that help us make antibodies. Different antibodies help protect us against a variety of harmful things. GD2 and GD3 gangliosides are substances found on the surface of most melanoma cells. They are also occasionally found on some normal cells. Large quantities of antibodies called monoclonal antibodies have been prepared in the laboratory against GD2 and GD3 and given to patients with metastatic melanoma. In about 10% of cases this has resulted in clinically relevant regression of melanomas. These monoclonal antibodies are not currently available or used in the clinic but studies in the laboratory indicate that vaccines against GD2 and GD3 can be as effective as monoclonal antibodies. In this trial we wish to raise the level of antibodies in your blood against GD2 and GD3. We will vaccinate you with the modified forms of GD2 called GD2 lactone and GD3 called GD3 lactone (GD3L), all attached to the antibody booster KLH, and mixed with the immune booster (immunologic adjuvant) QS-DG. While over a thousand patients have received vaccines with QS-21, the QS-DG used here is synthesized for the first time at MSKCC and is referred to as QS-DG rather than QS-21 which is purified from tree bark. QS-21 and QS-DG are, to the best of our knowledge chemically identical. It is unknown if using this bivalent vaccine will raise the level of antibodies in your blood to either ganglioside. It is unknown if raising the level of antibodies in your blood will lower your risk of relapse. This study will check your blood for production of antibodies, and check you for side effects.
NCT01265901	Study Title: IMA901 in Patients Receiving Sunitinib for Advanced/Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma.

NCT00079144	Study Title: Lymphocyte-Depleting Nonmyeloablative Preparative Chemotherapy Followed By Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion, Peptide Vaccine Plus Montanide ISA-51, and Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Treating a person's lymphocytes in the laboratory and reinfusing them may replace immune cells destroyed by chemotherapy. Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving a vaccine with Montanide ISA-51 may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's lymphocytes to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well lymphocyte-depleting nonmyeloablative (not damaging to bone marrow) chemotherapy followed by autologous lymphocyte infusion, peptide vaccine plus Montanide ISA-51, and interleukin-2 works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.
NCT00002767	Study Title: Interferon Alfa With or Without Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether melanoma vaccine plus interferon alfa is more effective than interferon alfa alone in treating patients with metastatic melanoma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interferon alfa with or without vaccine therapy in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.
NCT01949701	Study Title: Safety and Efficacy Study of Epitope Peptide To Treat HLA-A*02 Disease Controlled Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. Brief Summary: The investigators previously identified a novel HLA-A\*0201-restricted epitope peptide, which was derived from a cancer-testis antigen, URLC10 as a target for vaccination against lung cancer. In this clinical study, the investigators examine using the peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment to prevent relapse of the disease for HLA-A\*0201-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients whose disease are controlled after any standard therapies.
NCT01989572	Study Title: Sargramostim, Vaccine Therapy, or Sargramostim and Vaccine Therapy in Preventing Disease Recurrence in Patients With Melanoma That Has Been Removed By Surgery. Brief Summary: This randomized phase III trial studies sargramostim or vaccine therapy alone to see how well they work compared to sargramostim and vaccine therapy together in preventing disease recurrence in patients with melanoma that has been removed by surgery. Sargramostim may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether yeast derived sargramostim and vaccine therapy are more effective alone or together in preventing recurrence of melanoma.
NCT03199872	Study Title: RV001V, a RhoC Anticancer Vaccine, Against Metastasis From Solid Tumours. Brief Summary: The study will evaluate safety and immunological response to RhoC peptide vaccine in patients with prostate cancer.

NCT02054104	Study Title: Adjuvant Tumor Lysate Vaccine and Iscomatrix With or Without Metronomic Oral Cyclophosphamide and Celecoxib in Patients With Malignancies Involving Lungs, Esophagus, Pleura, or Mediastinum. Brief Summary: Background: During recent years, cancer-testis (CT) antigens (CTA), particularly those encoded by genes on the X chromosome (CT-X genes), have emerged as attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. Whereas malignancies of diverse histologies express a variety of CTAs, immune responses to these proteins appear uncommon in cancer patients, possibly due to low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, as well as immunosuppressive regulatory T cells present within tumor sites and systemic circulation of these individuals. Conceivably, vaccination of cancer patients with tumor cells expressing high levels of CTAs in combination with regimens that deplete or inhibit T regulatory cells will induce broad immunity to these antigens. In order to examine this issue, patients with primary lung and esophageal cancers, pleural mesotheliomas, thoracic sarcomas, thymic neoplasms and mediastinal germ cell tumors, as well as sarcomas, melanomas, germ cell tumors, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or mediastinum with no evidence of disease (NED) or minimal residual disease (MRD) following standard multidisciplinary therapy will be vaccinated with H1299 tumor cell lysates with Iscomatrix adjuvant. Vaccines will be administered with or without metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg by mouth (PO) twice a day (BID) x 7day (d) every (q) 14d), and celecoxib (400 mg PO BID). Serologic responses to a variety of recombinant CTAs as well as immunologic responses to autologous tumor or epigenetically modified autologous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphocytes will be assessed before and after a six month vaccination period. Primary Objectives: 1. To assess the frequency of immunologic responses to CTAs in patients with thoracic malignancies following vaccinations with H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix(TM) vaccines alone in comparison to patients with thoracic malignancies following vaccinations with H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix vaccines in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib. Secondary Objectives: 1. To examine if oral metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib therapy diminishes the number and percentage of T regulatory cells and diminishes activity of these cells in patients with thoracic malignancies are at risk of recurrence. 2. To examine if H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix(TM) vaccination enhances immunologic response to autologous tumor or epigenetically modified autologous EBV-transformed lymphocytes (B cells). Eligibility: * Patients with histologically or cytologically proven small cell or non-small cell lung cancer (SCLC;NSCLC), esophageal cancer (EsC), malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), thymic or mediastinal germ cell tumors, thoracic sarcomas, or melanomas, sarcomas, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or mediastinum who have no clinical evidence of active disease (NED), or minimal residual disease (MRD) not readily accessible by non-invasive biopsy or resection/radiation following standard therapy completed within the past 26 weeks. * Patients must be 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 2. * Patients must have adequate bone marrow, kidney, liver, lung and cardiac function. * Patients may not be on systemic immunosuppressive medications at time vaccinations commence. Design: * Following recovery from surgery, chemotherapy, or chemo/radiotherapy (XRT), patients with NED or MRD will be vaccinated via IM injection with H1299 cell lysates and Iscomatrix(TM) adjuvant monthly for 6 months. * Vaccines will be administered with or without with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide and celecoxib. * Systemic toxicities and immunologic response to therapy will be recorded. Pre and post vaccination serologic and cell mediated responses to a standard panel of CT antigens as well as autologous tumor cells (if available) and EBV-transformed lymphocytes will be assessed before and after vaccination. * Numbers/percentages and function of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood will be assessed before, during, and after vaccinations. * Patients will be followed in the clinic with routine staging scans until disease recurrence. * The trial will randomize 28 evaluable patients per arm to either receive vaccine alone or vaccine plus chemotherapy in order to have 80% power to determine if the frequency of immune responses on the combination arm exceeds that of the vaccine alone arm, if the expected frequencies of immune responses on the two arms were 20% and 50%, using a one-sided 0.10 alpha level Fisher's exact test. * Approximately 60 patients will be accrued to this trial.
NCT03935204	Study Title: Immunogenicity Study of Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Vaccine(6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58 Type)(E.Coli). Brief Summary: This phase II clinical study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of Recombinant Human Papillomavirus Vaccine (6,11,16,18,31,33,45,52,58 Type)(E.Coli)(hereafter called HPV vaccine), manufactured by Xiamen Innovax Biotech CO., LTD., in healthy adults aged 18-45 years old.
NCT00952692	Study Title: Study to Assess dHER2+AS15 Cancer Vaccine Given in Combination With Lapatinib to Patients With Metastatic Breast Cancer. Brief Summary: This is a phase I/II study to determine the safety and gain insight into the immune response of the immunologic agent dHER2+AS15 ASCI when administered in combination with lapatinib. This study is for patients with metastatic breast cancer (invasive breast cancer with stage IV disease) that overexpresses HER2 and is resistant to trastuzumab (Herceptin). The dHER2 + AS15 candidate Antigen-Specific Cancer Immunotherapeutic (ASCI) contains a recombinant protein termed dHER2, which is a truncated version of the HER2 protein. HER2 is a protein that is commonly overexpressed in breast cancer. This protein is combined with the immunological adjuvant AS15 Adjuvant System from GSK (GlaxoSmithKline), which is a liposomal formulation containing three immunostimulatory components. Lapatinib is FDA approved for use in combination with capecitabine for the treatment of subjects with advanced or metastatic breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2.
NCT02772094	"Study Title: Dendritic Cell-Based Tumor Vaccine Adjuvant Immunotherapy of Human Glioblastoma Multiforme (WHO Grade IV Gliomas). Brief Summary: Purposes: The purpose of this phase-II clinical trial is to determine whether or not ADCTA-G, a biologic ""vaccine"" preparation of patient's own dendritic cell (DC) for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) treatment, is safe and effective in extending the GBM patient's life. The current conventional multi-modal regimen that may include surgery for tumor resection or biopsy, temozolomide (TMZ) combined chemo-radiotherapy (CCRT) and TMZ adjuvant chemotherapy almost always leaves residual GBM cells to cause fatal recurrence, leading to medium survival period of 8 -15 months and over-all survival rates of about 30% in 2 years and \<3% in 5 years after diagnosis/surgery. Thus, in neurosurgical oncology practice, GBM patients in the first 2-year period during and after receiving multi-modal therapy are watched closely for possible GBM tumor recurrence and mortal disease relapse and immediately given palliative treatments and health care, until death. In this phase-II trial, GBM patient participants who receive ADCTA-G ""vaccine"" adjuvant immunotherapy (added to the conventional multi-modal regimen) will be similarly watched closely by treatments and health care visits at least biweekly from the date of surgery/diagnosis to 24 months, and if alive followed by weekly phone calls and scheduled health care visits at least once every 3 months, up to 72 months after surgery. In the trial protocol, ADCT-G in 10 doses is administered after surgery, over a period of 6 or 8 months, as an adjuvant immunotherapy of the conventional multimodal regimen. Individual ADCTA-G ""vaccine"" lot of every participant GBM patient is manufactured from patient's own monocyte-derived dendritic cells and the patient's own tumor cell antigens, both of which are prepared by a distinct method of procedures performed within air particle-free barrier good laboratory practice (GLP) facility. Previous phase I/II clinical trial of ADCTA-G ""vaccine"" immunotherapy administered as an adjuvant to the conventional multimodal regimen, has obtained promising safety and efficacy results for GBM patients in a clinical center. This phase-II clinical trial in China Medical University Hospital-Taichung will employ essentially the same clinical protocols and the same distinct ""vaccine"" manufacturing method of standard operational procedures (SOP), that is, the conventional multimodal regimen plus adjuvant immunotherapy using personal ADCTA-G ""vaccine"" lot for every GBM patient participants."
NCT00911560	"Study Title: Bivalent Vaccine With Escalating Doses of the Immunological Adjuvant OPT-821, in Combination With Oral Î²-glucan for High-Risk Neuroblastoma. Brief Summary: In the first part of this study we found the highest dose of the vaccine that did not have too many side effects. We are now trying to find out what effects the vaccine has when given at the same dose to all patients. The main treatment in this protocol is a vaccine. It is called a "" bivalent vaccine"" which means it has 2 antigens. An antigen is a specific protein on the surface of a cell. The antigens are called GD2L and GD3L. We want the vaccine to cause the patient's immune system to make antibodies against the antigens. Antibodies are made by the body to attack cancer (and to fight infections). If the patient can make antibodies against the 2 antigens in the vaccine, those antibodies might also attach to neuroblastoma cells because a lot of each antigen is on neuroblastoma (and very little on other parts of the body). Then, the attached antibodies would attract the patient's white blood cells to kill the neuroblastoma. This protocol also uses Î²-glucan which is a kind of sugar from yeast. Î²-glucan is taken by mouth and can help white blood cells kill cancer. The best way to get the body to make antibodies against the 2 antigens is to link each antigen to a protein called KLH (which stands for: keyhole limpet hemocyanin) and to mix them with a substance called QS-21. But it is hard to get enough QS-21 so we are using an identical substance called OPT-821, which we can get easily in large amounts for use in patients."

NCT01258868	Study Title: Tumor Cell Vaccines With ISCOMATRIX Adjuvant and Celecoxib in Patients Undergoing Resection of Lung and Esophageal Cancers and Malignant Pleural Mesotheliomas. Brief Summary: Background: - Recent research has shown that causing an immune response to tumor cells may help slow or stop the growth of tumors. One treatment that has come from this research involves collecting and modifying a cancer patient's tumor cells in the laboratory, then returning the cells to the patient as a vaccine to encourage the immune system to respond to them. Researchers are interested in testing tumor cell vaccines with an experimental drug called ISCOMATRIX , which can be added to a vaccine in order to elicit a stronger immune response in the body. ISCOMATRIX has not been approved for sale and use in any country and its use is still experimental, though it has been tested and used safely in other clinical studies. Researchers are also interested in determining whether the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib will improve the body's immune reaction if given with the vaccine. Objectives: - To assess the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell vaccines given with ISCOMATRIX and celecoxib in the treatment of lung and esophagus cancers. Eligibility: * Individuals at least 18 years of age who have primary small cell or non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer, or pleural mesothelioma that can be removed by surgery. * Only individuals whose tumor cells are able to produce a tumor cell line for vaccine development will be eligible for treatment. Design: * Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, and will have tumor tissue collected during their surgery to determine whether the tumor cells can be used to produce a vaccine. * Participants will take celecoxib twice daily for 7 days before having the first tumor cell vaccination. Participants will also have leukapheresis to collect blood cells for testing before the first vaccination. * Participants will receive one vaccine (which may be given in two shots) monthly for 6 months, and will continue to take celecoxib twice daily. One month after the 6th vaccine shot, participants will have another leukapheresis and skin test. If these tests show that a participant is responding to the vaccine, additional vaccines will be given every 3 months for up to 2 years. * Participants will have a physical exam and lab tests before each vaccination, blood samples and imaging studies every 3 months, and a skin test every 6 months. * Participants will have regular followup visits with imaging studies and blood samples for up to 5 years after the first vaccination, or until a new tumor develops.

NCT01313429	Study Title: Tumor Cell Vaccine for Patients Undergoing Surgery for Sarcomas, Melanomas, Germ Cell Tumors, or Malignancies That Have Metastasized to the Lungs, Pleura, or Mediastinum. Brief Summary: Background: - Certain types of cancers, including sarcoma and melanoma, have specific antigens (protein molecules) on their surfaces. Research has shown that producing an immune reaction to these antigens may be able to keep tumors from growing by encouraging the immune system to destroy the tumor cells. By creating a vaccine that contains antigens similar to those found on the cancer cells, researchers hope to cause an immune reaction that targets the cancer cells. However, more research is needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of this type of vaccine treatment. Objectives: - To determine whether a tumor cell vaccine, given to individuals who have had surgery to remove malignant tumors from the chest, can cause an immune reaction that will prevent the tumors from coming back. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have been diagnosed with cancer that has spread to the lungs, pleura, or mediastinum, and have recently had surgery to remove tumors in the chest. Design: * Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history, as well as blood tests and imaging studies. * Participants will have the option to have leukapheresis to collect white blood cells for studies on how the body is responding to the vaccine. Participants who agree to have this procedure will have it before the start of treatment and after the sixth and eighth vaccines. * Seven days before the first vaccine, participants will receive the chemotherapy drugs celecoxib and cyclophosphamide to take twice a day at home. * Participants will receive the experimental vaccine as an injection in the thigh or arm, and may receive it in two shots depending on how many cells are in each vaccine. Participants will receive a diary to monitor medication doses and side effects, as well as additional cyclophosphamide and celecoxib to take at home as directed by the study. * Participants will have one vaccine every month for 6 months, and will have regular blood tests and imaging studies. After the sixth vaccine, participants who have successfully responded to the treatment will have two additional vaccines given 3 months apart. * After the eighth vaccine, participants will have followup visits every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for up to 4 years....

NCT02187367	Study Title: Safety & Efficacy Study of EGF Cancer Vaccine to Treat Stage IV Biomarker Positive, Wild Type EGF-R NSCLC Patients. Brief Summary: The vaccine contains humanized recombinant antigen (EGF - Epithelial Growth Factor) and an adjuvant. The antibodies induced by vaccination will react with circulating EGF leading to removal of EGF from the circulation. As a result, binding to its target EGF-Receptor is prevented. Blocking of EGF-Receptor is preventing activation and stimulation of proliferation of tumour cell. A Phase 3 clinical trial on the EGF vaccine is ongoing in Cuba. The result from previous studies demonstrated positive correlation between extended survival and immune response against the vaccination in the late-stage NSCLC patients' age below 60 with improved quality of life. The purpose of this international Phase 3 trial is to determine whether the recombinant human EGF cancer vaccine is safe, immunogenic and effective in the treatment of stage IV NSCLC patients who are positive in the selective EGF biomarker and wild type EGF-Receptor compared to standard treatment and supportive care.
NCT05238467	"Study Title: Immunological Responses of COVID-19 Vaccination. Brief Summary: Cancer patients with COVID-19 have a 30% higher mortality rate compared to the general population and are considered a high-risk group by the American Association for Cancer Research that should be given ""high priority"" during COVID-19 vaccine administration. Although studies have suggested that vaccination during active treatment with chemo and/or radiation therapy provides suboptimal antibody response, the studies were underpowered and heterogeneous thus putting this conclusion into question. We need data in cancer patients on immunosuppressive chemotherapy at the time of COVID vaccination to understand how immune responses compare to healthy controls and cancer patients not on immunosuppressive therapy."
NCT06462001	Study Title: BCG + MMC: Adding Mitomycin C to BCG in High-risk, Non-muscle-invasive Bladder Cancer. Brief Summary: Instillation of Bacillus of Calmette-Guerin (BCG) into the urinary bladder (intravesical administration) improves rates of disease recurrence and progression after transurethral resection (TUR) of high risk, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), but over 30% of people still develop recurrent transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) despite optimal therapy with adjuvant intravesical BCG. Our meta-analysis, including a recent randomised phase 2 trial, suggests that outcomes might be improved further by using an adjuvant intravesical regimen that includes both Mitomycin (MM) and BCG. These promising findings require corroboration in a definitive, large scale, randomised phase 3 trial using standard techniques for intravesical administration.

Brief Summary: This is a non-randomized, open-label study in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma to determine the ability to generate human hybridomas from lymph nodes draining an autologous tumor vaccine injection and demonstrate that the hybridomas secrete glioblastoma-specific antibodies.
NCT01436968	Study Title: Phase 3 Study of ProstAtak Immunotherapy With Standard Radiation Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer. Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of ProstAtak immunotherapy in combination with radiation therapy for patients with intermediate-high risk localized prostate cancer. ProstAtak kills tumor cells and stimulates a cancer vaccine effect. Killing tumor cells in an immune stimulatory environment induces the body's immune system to detect and destroy cancer cells. ProstAtak has shown synergy with radiation without added toxicity and lower than expected recurrence rates in previous clinical trials. The hypothesis is that ProstAtak can lead to improvement in the clinical outcome for patients with prostate cancer. Participants will be randomized to the ProstAtak or control arm at a 2:1 ratio. Both arms receive standard external beam radiation therapy. Short-term androgen deprivation therapy may be given but is not required.

NCT03946358	"Study Title: Combination of UCPVax Vaccine and Atezolizumab for the Treatment of Human Papillomavirus Positive Cancers (VolATIL). Brief Summary: 70% all cases of cervical cancer, 95% of anal cancers and about 70% of oropharyngeal cancers are linked to Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV oncogenic proteins are trans-activators of telomerase. Indeed, E6 oncoprotein transactivates the human telomerase (hTert). Our group has conducted a clinical trial (NCT02402842) in advanced squamous cell anal cancer (SCCA) and investigators have shown a correlation between the presence of anti-HPV immunity and anti-telomerase T helpher 1 (TH1) CD4 T cell responses, establishing telomerase as an appropriate antigen in HPV-related cancers. Tumor-reactive CD4+ T cells have been found to ensure efficient effector Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTL) recruitment at the tumor site. Promoting tumor specific TH1 CD4 activation might be an attractive therapeutic option to enhance anti-PD-1/PD-L1 (Programmed cell Death-1/Programmed cell Death-Ligand1) efficacy. However, no option is currently available to expand tumor specific TH1 lymphocytes in most patients. Then, investigators have identified four novel MHC (Major Histocompatibility Complex) class II-restricted peptides derived from human telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) referred as ""Universal Cancer Peptides"" (UCP). UCPVax is a therapeutic cancer vaccine developed by our team and composed of two separate peptides called UCP2 and UCP4 derived from telomerase. This UCPVax vaccine is currently evaluated in a multicenter phase I/II study in Non Small Lung Cancer (NSCLC) (NCT2818426) and seems to show to be safe and immunogenic. PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint is a relevant candidate target for immunotherapy in HPV+ cancers, based on the prominent role of PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 in HPV-driven immune-evasion. There is a strong rational of using PD-1 therapy in HPV+ cancers, however anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment induces a limited number of long term responses in HPV disease. Combining anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy with an antitumor vaccine gains serious consideration in HPV+ cancers. Indeed, anti-cancer vaccines can induce tumor-specific T cells expansion and activation and therefore restore the cancer-immunity cycle in patients lacking pre-existing anti-tumor responses. So investigators propose to determine the clinical interest and immunological efficacy of a treatment combining the CD4 helper T-inducer cancer vaccine (UCPVax) with atezolizumab in patients with HPV+ cancers by evaluation of the objective response rate at 4 months according to iRecist criteria."

NCT00705835	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy of Prostate Cancer Patients With Recombinant Soluble Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (Rs-PSMA) Plus the Immunological Adjuvant Alhydrogel. Brief Summary: The purpose of this research is to help us study a vaccine treatment for patients with prostate cancer. A vaccine is a medicine that teaches the body to destroy harmful infections and other diseases, such as cancer. Your immune system is made up of many different types of cells which fight infection and disease in your body. A vaccine may stimulate the immune system to destroy the cancer cells. It may also help to slow the growth of the cancer. The vaccine is a solution given as an injection into or under the skin. It is made up of several parts. The first part is PSMA, a protein present in many cancers, especially prostate cancer. It is referred to as rsPSMA when made in a laboratory for this study and is mixed with a material called Alhydrogel (aluminum hydroxide suspension) which helps the immune system to make more cancer-fighting cells.
NCT00089063	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy With or Without Sargramostim in Treating Patients Who Have Undergone Surgery for Melanoma. Brief Summary: This randomized phase II trial is studying vaccine therapy and sargramostim to see how well they work compared to vaccine therapy alone in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage IIB, stage IIC, stage III, or stage IV melanoma. Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood. Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim may make a stronger immune response.

NCT02211027	Study Title: Biological Vaccine: Semi-allogeneic Human Fibroblasts (MRC-5) Transfected With DNA. Brief Summary: Hypothesis The incidence of toxicity in patients receiving the tumor DNA-transfected fibroblast vaccine will be acceptably low and the immunologic response rate sufficiently high to warrant further study of this therapy. The study of the vaccine will proceed in two stages after the method of Simon (102). In the first stage, 15 patients will be accrued and treated. If two or fewer objective immunologic responses occur, the study will be terminated. If 3 or more responses are observed, the study will proceed to the second stage, accruing an additional 22 patients. If the second stage is complete and a total of 9 or more immunologic responses are observed among the 37 patients treated, the treatment response rate for the vaccine will be considered high enough to warrant further study. Conversely, if the evaluation of the vaccine concludes at the first stage, or if 8 or fewer total immunologic responses occur after completing the second stage, the vaccine will not be considered for further study.
NCT00001827	Study Title: p53 Vaccine for Ovarian Cancer. Brief Summary: This study will examine whether vaccination with a p53 peptide can boost an immune response to ovarian cancer and what the side effects are of the vaccine. Many patients with ovarian cancer have an altered (mutated) gene called p53 that causes the production of abnormal proteins found in their tumor cells. The body s immune system may try, unsuccessfully, to fight these abnormal proteins. In this study, ovarian cancer patients with a p53 abnormality will be vaccinated with a p53 peptide a part of the same abnormal protein found in their tumor to try to boost their body s immune response to the cancer. Patients will be divided into two groups. Group A will have four p53 peptide vaccinations three weeks apart, injected under the skin. The injection will include a drug called ISA-51, which increases the effect of the vaccine. This group will also receive two other drugs that boost the immune system, IL-2 and GM-CSF. Group B will have four p53 peptide vaccinations three weeks apart. The peptide will be mixed with the patient s own blood cells and infused into a vein. This group will also receive IL-2, but not GM-CSF. All study candidates will be tested to see if their cancer has a p53 abnormality and if their immune system mounted a defense against it. These tests may include a tumor biopsy (removal of a small part of the tumor for microscopic examination); lymphapheresis (a procedure to take blood, remove white blood cells called lymphocytes, and return the red cells); and an immune response test similar to a skin test for tuberculosis. During the study, patients will have additional skin tests and blood tests.

NCT00923910	Study Title: Wilm's Tumor 1 Protein Vaccine to Treat Cancers of the Blood. Brief Summary: Background: * Most patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and many patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) have a protein called Wilm's Tumor 1 (WT1) in their cancer cells. This protein is thought to be able to influence the growth of these cancers. * A vaccine made with the WT1 protein may boost the immune system to help fight these cancers in patients whose cancer cells contain the protein. Objectives: * To determine the safety, effectiveness and side effects of giving the WT1 vaccine and donor white blood cells to patients with AML, ALL, CML or NHL who have previously received standard treatment and undergone stem cell transplantation. * To determine the immune response to the WT1 vaccine and donor white blood cells in these patients and to determine if the response is related to the amount of WT1 protein in the patient's cancer cells. Eligibility: * Patients between 1 and 75 years of age with the blood antigen human leukocyte antigen (HLA-A2) and the WT1 cancer protein who have persistent or recurrent blood cancers after stem cell transplantation. * The prior stem cell transplant donor must be willing to provide additional cells, which will be used to prepare the cellular vaccines and for donor lymphocyte (white blood cell) infusions. Design: * Patients are given the WT1 vaccine every 2 weeks for 6 weeks (weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10). Each vaccination consists of two injections in the upper arm or thigh. * On weeks 0, 4 and 8, patients also receive white blood cells from a donor to enhance the immune response. The cells are also given as a 15- to 30-minute infusion through a vein about 1 hour after the vaccine injection. Donor infusions are given only to patients with mild or no graft-vs-host disease resulting from their prior stem cell transplantation. * Periodic physical examinations, blood and urine tests, scans to evaluate disease and other tests as needed are done for 12 months after enrollment in the study.

NCT06054308	Study Title: Mesothelin-targeted CAR-T Cells as a Neo-adjuvant Treatment in Patients With Resectable Pancreatic Cancers: a Feasibility Study. Brief Summary: Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a cancer of grave prognosis, with only about 10% of patients alive at 5 years after diagnosis. Primary surgical resection is feasible in about 10-15% of patients with an early-stage disease. Another 30-35% of patients have locally advanced disease with invasion into major vasculature but without detectable metastases. Surgery offers a chance of cure. The introduction of adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy has improved prognosis after surgery. In the management of patients with PDAC, the role of neoadjuvant therapy is less certain. Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer can in theory control early systemic spread and improve rate of having no macroscopic or microscopic residual tumor (R0 resection). In the The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer (ESPAC-5) study, neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy did not increase rate of resection who had borderline-resectable disease but appears to improve overall survival (OS). Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy may represent a new paradigm in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a 40 kDa membrane protein not expressed in normal cells, but highly expressed in a variety of cancer cells, such as mesothelioma, lung, breast, ovarian, gastric and pancreatic cancer. MSLN is expressed about 80% of PDAC. There are several immunotherapies targeting MSLN for PDAC treatment, including antibody-based drugs (monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins), vaccines, and CAR-T cell therapy. The safety of CAR-T cells targeting MSLN in the treatment of cancers has also been verified in several clinical trials on lung cancers (NCT01583686, NCT02414269, NCT01355965). Professor Li Peng's group at the Chinese Academy of Science designed third generation CAR-T cells targeting MSLN and validated their use in both human PDAC cell lines, animal models, and in 4 patients with advanced malignancies. In a 42-year-old man with metastatic PDAC, the MSLN targeted CAR-T treatment led to complete response follow several hepatic artery infusion and intravenous infusion. These early cases confirmed the safety of these MSLN targeted CAR-T cells. In the current proposed feasibility study, the researcher hypothesise that Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided injection of MSLN targeted CAR-T cells into PDAC can induce a tumor response, improve rate of R0 resection and translate into better patient survival.
NCT00938223	Study Title: Evaluation of the Immunogenicity of Vaccination With Multiple Synthetic Melanoma Peptides With Granulocyte-macrophage Colony-stimulating Factor (GM-CSF)-In-Adjuvant, in Patients With Advanced Melanoma.

NCT05163223	Study Title: Therapeutic Cancer Vaccine (AST-301, pNGVL3-hICD) in Patients With Breast Cancer. Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an adjuvant treatment of therapeutic cancer vaccine (AST-301, pNGVL3-hICD) in patients with HER2-low expression (IHC 1+ or 2+ and ISH-) and hormone receptor-negative(ER-, PR-) breast cancer with residual disease after neoadjuvant treatment. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either the Experimental arm (combination of AST-301/rhuGM CSF and standard adjuvant therapy) or the Control arm (combination of placebo/rhuGM CSF and standard adjuvant therapy). Standard adjuvant chemotherapy will be pembrolizumab or capecitabine. Adjuvant therapy will be administered in compliance with the NCCN guideline for breast cancer (Version 8, 2021), and IP (AST-301) will be administered 3 times every 3 weeks in the adjuvant treatment period, with a booster administered at 24 weeks (Â±7 days) post the third dose of IP administration. Survival follow up will be performed to determine invasive Disease Free survival(iDFS).
NCT00273910	Study Title: Evaluation of the Impact of Adjuvants Accompanying Peptide Immunization in High-Risk Melanoma. Brief Summary: This study will evaluate the immunization effects of a vaccine for patients who are at risk for recurrence of their skin cancer. That is, the risk of cancer is higher if melanoma has invaded deep into the skin or lymph nodes. Currently, the only therapy that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved for preventing recurrence of melanoma is alpha-interferon. But the research data are controversial. In this study, the vaccine to be used, called gp100, contains a piece of a protein called a peptide, which melanoma cancer cells produce. Patients 16 and older who have had confirmed melanoma surgically removed and whose tissue type is tested as being human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A serotype group (HLA-A2), through a specific blood test, may be eligible for this study. Up to 132 participants will be enrolled. There will be a physical examination and collection of blood samples for tests, and making sure that x-rays and scans are current. Patients will be randomly assigned to four groups. Group 1 will receive the peptide with an adjuvant (assistant) oil-based liquid called Montanide ISA-51, as an injection in the thigh. Group 2 will receive gp100, Montanide, and a cream called imiquimod, which the FDA has approved for treating genital warts and herpes but that may help immune cells in the skin to recognize the vaccine. Imiquimod will be applied to the skin for 5 days. Group 3 will receive gp100 mixed in salt water given as several mini-doses under the skin of the thigh. Group 4 will also receive several mini-doses of gp100 mixed in saline, as well as imiquimod cream applied to the skin for 5 days. All patients will receive the gp100 every 3 weeks for 12 weeks. Every dose is a cycle, with four cycles considered a course of therapy. If the melanoma does not return or patients do not experience side effects from this therapy, then the courses of vaccine will repeated for up to 12 cycles of therapy (3 courses over 33 weeks). Side effects of the peptide vaccination include local swelling, swelling of local lymph nodes, bruising, and pain and redness at the injection sites. There may be chills or fever. Patients will be watched closely for such side effects. To study how the vaccine changes the action of cells in the immune system, patients' white blood cells (lymphocytes) will be obtained, involving a separate informed consent. The procedure, called leukaphersis, requires inserting a needle into the arm, to obtain blood going into a machine, which divides the blood into red cells, plasma (or the serum part), and lymphocytes. The lymphocytes are removed, and the plasma and red cells returned to the patient through a second needle in the other arm. Risks associated with the procedure include fainting, which can be prevented by patients' eating before coming to the lab, and bleeding and infection at the needle site. Patients will undergo leukapheresis will be done about four times: before receiving the vaccine, 3 weeks after the first four doses, and then after 8 cycles and 12 cycles. Patients assigned to the groups receiving imiquimod will be asked to record every time they apply that cream and describe any symptoms developed during the study. All patients will be watched closely for any sign that their melanoma has returned. Before and throughout the study, multiple blood tests will be conducted. The vaccine, Montanide, and imiquimod may increase patients' immune system in fighting off new tumors, but that is not known now. However, the study may provide information that will be useful in treating melanoma patients in the future.

NCT06195618	"Study Title: Personalized Vaccine for TNBC Immunotherapy. Brief Summary: Due to their genetic instability, breast tumors that do not express receptors for Estrogens, Progestagens or amplify the Her2 / neu oncogene \[called triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)\] and other tumors such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, accumulate numerous mutations that make them highly resistant to different regimens of chemo- or radiotherapy, thereby generating high morbidity and mortality. However, immunology can turn the genetic instability of tumors into the Achilles' tendon. Evidence of this has been revealed in Phase I clinical studies in patients with melanoma and lung cancer in an advanced stage of metastasis treated with Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) to decrease immunosuppression, in whom peptides containing mutations presented in Major Complex molecules Histocompatibility of Class I (MHC I) of the tumor itself results in their recognition as ""foreign"" neo-antigens leading to the efficient destruction of the tumor by anti-tumor CD8 + T lymphocytes that are amplified when they are vaccinated with these peptides. For this reason, the identification of non-synonymous mutations of single amino acid and vaccination with 25 amino acid peptides that incorporate these mutations (synthetic vaccines) is emerging today as an alternative for immunotherapy of cancers responsible for high mortality in humans. In an approach that takes 16 weeks, today, it is possible to go from the analysis of the tumor's transcriptome (which allows identifying the universe of tumor mutations) to the patient's vaccination with a personalized vaccine that contains neo-antigens of his tumor. TNBC is the most aggressive breast tumor, representing around 15% of breast cancers in our environment. While generally, at least 30% of women with other types of metastatic breast cancer survive 5 years after diagnosis, most patients diagnosed with metastatic TNBC die within this time. The lack of selective therapies and the poor prognosis of patients with TNBC make their therapeutic management difficult, so the implementation of new therapies for this type of tumor is the main focus of researchers who seek more effective and selective treatments to improve the life expectancy of patients without compromising their quality of life. The genetic instability and high rate of mutations of the TNBC most likely favor the generation of neo-epitopes. Still, due to the immunosuppressive environment of the tumor, it escapes the immunosurveillance of the immune system. Despite the high mortality induced by this tumor, a percentage of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with agents such as Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (AC) + Taxanes respond to this chemotherapy regimen. In particular, the anti-tumor effect of AC is attributed to two things: (i) the direct cytotoxic effect on the tumor cell, (ii) the immunostimulation of T lymphocytes promoted by Immunogenic Cell Death (ICD) selectively induced by these drugs. Therefore, in this project, we propose to carry out the first clinical study in Colombia of vaccination of patients with TNBC with synthetic peptides that contain mutations of their own tumor to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of this type of personalized vaccine as a therapeutic alternative for this tumor. Achieving the specific objectives set out in this project would mean that we have been validated in Colombia the experimental design necessary to identify unique epitopes in tumors and demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines. We consider that having achieved the above; we will have taken an important step towards the implementation in our country of the use of this type of vaccine for immunotherapy not only of TNBC but of other tumors such as glioblastoma, gastric, esophagus, and pancreas, highly fatal due to its high mutation rate."

NCT05683834	Study Title: Trial Evaluating the Immunogenicity and Safety of an Adjuvanted Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) Glycoprotein 350 Vaccine in EBV-seronegative Persons. Brief Summary: Background: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes most cases of infectious mononucleosis (mono). Mono can cause fatigue that lasts more than 6 months, and some people can have severe complications. EBV infection may also contribute to some cancers and autoimmune diseases. Currently, there are no approved therapies or vaccines for EBV infection. Objective: To test a vaccine against EBV. Eligibility: Healthy people aged 18 to 25 years. Design: Participants will be screened in 2 parts. They will have a blood test. If that test shows they have never had an EBV infection, they will have a second clinic visit.

NCT04911621	Study Title: Adjuvant Dendritic Cell Immunotherapy for Pediatric Patients With High-grade Glioma or Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma. Brief Summary: Childhood aggressive gliomas are rare brain tumors with very poor prognosis. Due to the tumor's location and infiltrative nature, surgical removal is not always possible, and even when resection is performed and combined with chemo- and/or radiotherapy, tumor cells frequently persist, eventually giving rise to tumor recurrence. A promising strategy to eradicate persisting tumor cells is vaccination with dendritic cells (DC). DC are immune cells that play an important role in organizing the body's defense against cancer. The goal of DC vaccination is to activate these natural anti-tumor defense mechanisms to delay or prevent tumor progression or recurrence. Previous clinical studies have demonstrated that DC vaccination is well-tolerated, safe and capable of eliciting tumorspecific immunity. A clinical study including 10 pediatric patients (aged â¥ 12 months and \< 18 years at the time of signing the informed consent) with brain (stem) tumors is initiated at the Antwerp University Hospital to investigate intradermal vaccination with WT1 mRNA-loaded autologous monocyte-derived DCs, either combined with first-line chemoradiation treatment or administered as adjuvant therapy following previous therapies. The general objective of this phase I/II clinical study is (1) to demonstrate that WT1-targeted DC vaccine production and administration in pediatric patients with HGG and DIPG, either combined with first-line chemoradiation treatment or administered as adjuvant therapy following previous therapies, is feasible and safe, (2) to study vaccine-induced immune responses, (3) to document patients' quality of life and clinical outcome for comparison with current patients' outcome allowing indication of the added value.

NCT00001703	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy With Tumor Specific Mutated VHL Peptides in Adult Cancer Patients With Renal Cell Carcinoma. Brief Summary: About 27,000 new cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) are diagnosed every year in the United States. 11,000 of these cases will die from the disease. More than half of patients present with advanced or metastatic disease for which chemotherapy plays a very limited role. Therefore, development of another therapeutic approach is needed. Cancers in humans are commonly associated with mutations in dominant and recessive oncogenes. These genes produce mutated proteins that are unique to cancer cells. Von Hipple-Lindau (VHL) gene which is associated with the development of the VHL disease, has been recently mapped and cloned, and it is found to be mutated in 57% of sporadic renal cell carcinomas. Data in mice have shown the generation of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) that are capable of detecting endogenous cytoplasmic peptide derived from mutated oncogenes. In addition, we have recently demonstrated, by conducting different phase I clinical trials in which we vaccinate cancer patients with mutated Ras or p53 peptides corresponding to the abnormality patients harbor in their tumors, that in some patients we can generate immunological responses represented by the generation of lymphocytes (CD4+ and/or CD8+). In the current study, we would like to extend our observations to test whether VHL tumor suppressor protein can be immunologically targeted by vaccination. We have identified specific epitopes along the amino acid sequence of the VHL protein, which represent known specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class-I binding motifs. These amino acids stretches in the VHL protein correspond to the area of the point mutation hot spots. Therefore, we propose to treat patients with sporadic RCC who carry VHL mutations in their tumors with corresponding mutant VHL peptide vaccination. This vaccination will be done either by using pulsed-autologous peripheral mononuclear cells with the peptides, or peptides administered subcutaneously alone or in combination with cytokines.

NCT01204684	"Study Title: Dendritic Cell Vaccine for Patients With Brain Tumors. Brief Summary: The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the most effective immunotherapy vaccine components in patients with malignant glioma. Teh investigators previous phase I study (IRB #03-04-053) already confirmed that this vaccine procedure is safe in patients with malignant brain tumors, and with an indication of extended survival in several patients. However, the previous trial design did not allow us to test which formulation of the vaccine was the most effective. This phase II study will attempt to dissect out which components are most effective together. Dendritic cells (DC) (cells which ""present"" or ""show"" cell identifiers to the immune system) isolated from the subject's own blood will be treated with tumor-cell lysate isolated from tumor tissue taken from the same subject during surgery. This pulsing (combining) of antigen-presenting and tumor lysate will be done to try to stimulate the immune system to recognize and destroy the patient's intracranial brain tumor. These pulsed DCs will then be injected back into the patient intradermally as a vaccine. The investigators will also utilize adjuvant imiquimod or poly ICLC (interstitial Cajal-like cell) in some treatment cohorts. It is thought that the host immune system might be taught to ""recognize"" the malignant brain tumor cells as ""foreign"" to the body by effectively presenting unique tumor antigens to the host immune cells (T-cells) in vivo."
NCT04864379	Study Title: Clinical Study of a Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine Combined With Anti-PD-1 and RFA in Patients With Solid Tumors. Brief Summary: This research study is evaluating a new type of personalized neoantigen cancer vaccineï¼iNeo-Vac-P01ï¼combined with anti-PD-1 antibody and radiofrequency ablation as a possible treatment for patients with advanced solid tumors. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of iNeo-Vac-P01 in combination with anti-PD-1 and radiofrequency ablation, so as to provide a new personalized therapeutic strategy for patients. It is known that cancer patients have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the participant's body fight any tumor cells that could cause the cancer to come back in the future. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune response.

NCT02543749	"Study Title: DC Vaccination in CML. Brief Summary: The aim of this phase I/II trial is induction of anti leukemic T cell immunity in a clinical situation of ""minimal residual disease"". This might be a strategy to immunologically eradicate the residual leukemia cells. Patients to be included are chronic phase bcr/abl+ CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) patients in stable cytogenetic and/or molecular remission. These patients can be included if they have: 1. not achieved a CMR (complete molecular response) or 2. achieved bcr/abl \< 10% on qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) (=MCyR) (Major cytogenic Response), but less than a CCyR (complete cytogenic Response). Autologous DC (Dendritic cells), generated under GMP (Good manufacturing conditions) conditions, are used as a vaccine. These DC constitutively express all putative tumor antigens. In order to ensure sufficient presentation of distinct CML-related antigens, particularly in good responders to TKIs, DC are additionally pulsed with peptides from bcr/abl, WT-1 (Wilms Tumor Protein) and proteinase-3. Monitoring of T cell reactivity against these peptides can then serve as surrogate marker for anti leukemic immunity induced by the vaccine. Vaccination is performed with 10\^7 DC i.d. (intra dermal) in weeks 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23 and 26. KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) is used as an adjuvant for vaccine preparations in weeks 3, 5 and 8 (and 11)."

NCT00773097	Study Title: Study of the MUC1 Peptide-Poly-ICLC Adjuvant Vaccine in Individuals With Advanced Colorectal Adenoma. Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immune response to MUC1 - poly-ICLC vaccine, an investigational or study vaccine. The MUC1 - poly-ICLC vaccine is being tested in persons with a history of advanced adenomatous polyps, the precursor to colorectal cancer. The MUC1 - poly-ICLC vaccine is being developed to prevent polyps from advancing into colon cancer and to prevent polyps from recurring. MUC1 is mucus that is normally present on the lining of the human colon. However, MUC1 is expressed in a larger amount and in a modified form on adenomatous polyps and colorectal cancer. These changes in MUC1 are thought to be part of the process of progression from adenomas toward cancer. The goal of a vaccine is to help the immune system in the body identify the changes in MUC1 that accompany the progression to cancer and eliminate the abnormal cells that make abnormal MUC1.

NCT01349647	Study Title: Immunization With a Pentavalent Vaccine Composed of KLH-conjugates of GD2L, GD3L, Globo H, Fucosyl GM1, and N-Propionylated Polysialic Acid. Brief Summary: Even when small cell lung cancer responds well to treatment with chemotherapy, it has a tendency to grow back and to spread. The investigators are interested in testing new therapies aimed at decreasing this risk. This study tests a vaccine, which is a substance injected under the skin which can cause an immune response. The hope is that the body will make antibodies to the vaccine which will also react against the cancer. The vaccine is specific for small cell lung cancer. It combines several components (small cell lung cancer targets) that have been tested individually in patients with small cell lung cancer or other cancers (GD2, GD3, Globo H, Fucosyl GM1 and N-propionylated polysialic acid). Two other substances (KLH and OPT-821) are added which boost the immune system. This study will have two groups of patients. The first group will receive the vaccines along with one cycle of chemotherapy. The second group will receive the vaccines without chemotherapy.
NCT00694551	Study Title: PSMA and TARP Peptide Vaccine With Poly IC-LC Adjuvant in HLA-A2 (+) Patients With Elevated PSA After Initial Definitive Treatment. Brief Summary: Pilot Immunotherapy Study of Combination Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) and T-cell receptor Î³ alternate reading frame protein (TARP) Peptide With Poly IC-LC Adjuvant in Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLA)-A2 (+) Patients With Elevated prostatic specific antigen (PSA) After Initial Definitive Treatment. The purpose of the study is to see if the PSMA/TARP proteins in the vaccine, along with the Hiltonol, can arouse and train the immune system to kill the prostate cancer cells. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer and is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in U.S. males. It is curable when it is confined to the prostate (kept from spreading) using surgery or radiation treatments. In some patients the cancer can come back after these treatments. Treatment options for prostate cancer that comes back include procedures or medications which may have significant risks and side effects. Another plan is being looked at that uses the body's immune system to attack prostate cancer cells. A vaccine has been developed that has proteins found in prostate cancer cells. One of the proteins is called PSMA and the other is called TARP. In addition to these proteins, another substance called Poly IC-LC (Hiltonol) will be added to the vaccine to boost its ability to start the immune system.

NCT01836432	"Study Title: Immunotherapy Study in Borderline Resectable or Locally Advanced Unresectable Pancreatic Cancer. Brief Summary: Unfortunately, despite the best clinical efforts and breakthroughs in biotechnology, most patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer continue to die from the rapid progression of their disease. One primary reason for this is that the disease is typically without symptoms until significant local and/or distant spread has occurred and is often beyond the chance for cure at the time of the diagnosis. The lack of any treatment to substantially increase long term survival rates is reflected by the poor outcomes associated with this disease, specifically time to disease progression and overall survival. However, another important part of the body is now being looked at as a target for therapy against this disease - the immune system. Scientists have clearly shown that pancreatic tumor cells produce a number of defective proteins, or express normal proteins in highly uncharacteristic ways, as part of this cancer. In some cancers, these abnormalities can cause an immune response to the cancer cells much in the way one responds to infected tissue. In progressive cancers however, the immune system fails to effectively identify or respond to these abnormalities and the cancer cells are not attacked or destroyed for reasons not yet fully understood. This clinical trial proposes a new way to stimulate the immune system to recognize pancreatic cancer cells and to stimulate an immune response that destroys or blocks the growth of the cancer. This new method of treatment helps the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients to ""identify"" the cancerous tissue so that it can be eliminated from the body. As an example, most people are aware that patients with certain diseases may require an organ transplant to replace a damaged kidney or heart. After receiving their transplant, these patients receive special drugs because they are at great danger of having an immune response that destroys or ""rejects"" the transplanted organ. This ""rejection"" occurs when their immune system responds to differences between the cells of the transplanted organ and their own immune system by attacking the foreign tissue in the same way as it would attack infected tissue. When the differences between foreign tissues and the patient's body are even larger, as with the differences between organs from different species, the rejection is very rapid, highly destructive, and the immunity it generates is longlasting. This is called hyperacute rejection and the medicine used to immunize patients in this protocol tries to harness this response to teach a patient's immune system to fight their pancreatic cancer just as the body would learn to reject a transplanted organ from an animal. To do this, Algenpantucel-L immunotherapy contains human pancreatic cancer cells that contain a mouse gene that marks the cancer cells as foreign to patient's immune systems. The immune system therefore attacks these cancer cells just as they would attack any truly foreign tissue, destroying as much as it can. Additionally, the immune system is stimulated to identify differences (aside from the mouse gene) between these cancer cells and normal human tissue as foreign. This ""education"" of the immune system helps treat the patient because pancreatic cancer cells already present in a treated patient are believed to show some of the same differences from normal tissue as the modified pancreatic cancer cells in the product. Due to these similarities, the immune system, once ""educated"" by the Algenpantucel-L immunotherapy, identifies the patient's cancer as foreign and attacks. The chemotherapy combination to be used in this study has been shown to improve survival in advanced pancreatic cancer and is being combined with an experimental pancreatic cancer immunotherapy that stimulates the immune system to recognize and attack the cancer. One goal of this study is to determine whether chemotherapy and immunotherapies can work cooperatively to increase anti-tumor effects to levels beyond what would be seen with either treatment alone. In this experimental study, all patients are given a strong combination of anti-tumor chemotherapies while some patients are also given injections of an immunotherapy drug consisting of two types of pancreatic cancer cells that we have modified to make them more easily recognized and attacked by the immune system. We propose to test this new treatment protocol in patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer to demonstrate that treatment with the immunotherapy increases the time until the tumor progresses or increases overall survival when given in combination with the current standard of care therapy for this disease."

NCT00023842	Study Title: BCG With or Without Mitomycin in Treating Patients With Bladder Cancer. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Biological therapies such as BCG use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known if BCG is more effective with or without mitomycin. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of BCG plus mitomycin with that of BCG alone in treating patients who have bladder cancer.
NCT03012100	Study Title: Multi-epitope Folate Receptor Alpha Peptide Vaccine, GM-CSF, and Cyclophosphamide in Treating Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer. Brief Summary: This randomized phase II trial studies how well multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and cyclophosphamide work to prevent the recurrence of stage 1-3 triple negative breast cancer. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving multi-epitope folate receptor alpha peptide vaccine, sargramostim (GM-CSF), and cyclophosphamide may work well together to prevent cancer recurrence after surgery and other standard treatments for triple negative breast cancer.

NCT00821652	Study Title: Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo-controlled Topical Resiquimod Adjuvant for NY-ESO-1 Protein Vaccination. Brief Summary: The study is designed to see if a course of injections containing the NY-ESO-1 protein (a tumor antigen, marker expressed by tumors); in combination with an immune stimulant (adjuvant) Montanide, with or without resiquimod (another adjuvant) is well tolerated and safe in patients with surgically resected Stage IIB, IIC, Stage III or Stage IV (AJCC criteria) melanoma, a tumor that expresses NY-ESO-1. In addition, this study is designed to see if the patient's body's defense (immune) system can be boosted (strengthened) by this vaccine and if the addition of resiquimod to the vaccine makes this more likely.
NCT01827137	"Study Title: WT1 Analog Peptide Vaccine in Patients With Multiple Myeloma Following Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation. Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to see if the investigator can help the immune system to work against myeloma through the use/administration of a peptide vaccine (immunotherapy agent) directed against the Wilms Tumor 1 (WT1) protein called galinpepimut-S (or GPS, for brief). Because cancer is produced by the patient's own body, the immune system does not easily recognize and fight cancer cells. The immune system needs to be ""trained"" to do this; the latter goal is accomplished by using a vaccine consisting of selected fragments of the target antigen, in this case, WT1. This disease has been selected for this study because the WT1 protein is often present in myeloma cells. WT1 is a gene that is involved in the normal development of kidneys and other organs. When the WT1 gene becomes abnormal, it can make proteins involved in the development of cancer, i.e., can acquire the properties of a true ""oncogene"". This study will determine whether the vaccine against the WT1 antigen (present in malignant plasmacytes) can cause an immune response which is safe, but also able to keep the myeloma from either coming back or progressing."

NCT00072137	Study Title: Neoadjuvant Intravesical Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Bladder Carcinoma Who Are Undergoing Cystectomy. Brief Summary: This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy given directly into the bladder in treating patients who are undergoing surgery to remove all or part of the bladder. Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving a vaccine directly into the bladder before surgery may cause a stronger immune response and keep tumor cells from coming back after surgery.
NCT00059475	Study Title: Peptide Vaccination for Patients at High Risk for Recurrent Melanoma. Brief Summary: This study will examine the effectiveness and side effects of an experimental vaccine to prevent recurrence of melanoma. The likelihood of melanoma returning is higher in patients who have melanoma lesions deep in the skin, in patients who have had positive lymph nodes, and in patients who have had surgery for metastatic disease (cancer that has spread beyond the primary site). Melanoma tumors produce proteins called glycoprotein 100 (gp100) and melanoma-associated antigen recognized by T cells 1 (MART-1). Vaccination with specific pieces of these proteins (peptides) may boost the immune system's fight against the cancer. The vaccine injections are mixed with an oil-based substance called Montanide ISA-51, which is intended to increase the immune response to the peptide. Patients 16 years of age and older whose melanoma has been surgically removed and who are currently free of disease may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a physical examination and blood and urine tests. An electrocardiogram (EKG), x-rays and other imaging studies will be done if recent results are not available. Some candidates may require heart tests, such as a cardiac stress test or echocardiogram, or lung function tests. In addition, all candidates will be tested for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) tissue type; patients must be type human leukocyte antigens (HLA-A)\*0201, the type on which this vaccine is based. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of four different vaccines to determine which peptides offer the best immunity. Each treatment course consists of two injections of the vaccines every 3 weeks for four times. The injections are given under the skin of the thigh. After every other treatment course (every 6 months), patients will undergo a series of x-rays and scans to look for tumor. The immunizations may continue for up to 12 months as long as the melanoma does not return. The injections are given at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center. Patients are monitored for 1 hour after each injection and have blood tests and a physical examination to look for treatment side effects. Patients will be followed with blood tests every 12 weeks to monitor body functions. They will also undergo leukapheresis-a procedure to collect white blood cells-before starting treatment and about 3 to 4 weeks after the fourth vaccine to evaluate how the vaccines affect the action of the immune system cells. For this procedure, blood is drawn through a needle in the arm, similar to donating blood. The blood goes through a machine that separates out the lymphocytes (white blood cells), and the rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm. Some patients may undergo a biopsy-surgical removal of a small piece of tissue under local anesthetic-of normal skin and tumor or lymph node tissue to examine the effects of the vaccines on the tumor immune cells. Patients whose disease returns during the first course of vaccine therapy will have surgery to remove the tumor and will continue to receive the vaccine treatment. Patients whose tumor returns after completing one course of therapy may receive a substance called interleukin-2 (IL-2), which can boost immune function against the tumor. interleukin-2 (IL-2) is given intravenously (through a small tube placed in a vein) every 8 hours for 4 days. This regimen is repeated after 10 to 14 days. Those who respond to interleukin-2 (IL-2) will have a third course of treatment after 2 months. Patients whose disease recurs after treatment will be taken off the study and will be referred back to their referring physician or to another study, if an appropriate one is available.
NCT00589875	Study Title: Phase 2a Study of CAN-2409 With Standard Radiation Therapy for Malignant Glioma. Brief Summary: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety and potential efficacy of CAN-2409 (also known / previously described as AdV-tk, GMCI) for malignant gliomas. The approach used an adenoviral vector (disabled virus) engineered to express the Herpes thymidine kinase gene (aglatimagene besadenovec, CAN-2409), followed by an antiherpetic prodrug, valacyclovir. CAN-2409 was injected into the resection bed after standard tumor surgery and valacyclovir pills were taken for 14 days. Standard radiation and chemotherapy were administered which have been shown to work cooperatively with CAN-2409 + prodrug to kill tumor cells. The hypothesis is that this combination therapy can be safely delivered and will lead to improvement in the clinical outcome for patients with newly diagnosed malignant gliomas, including glioblastoma multiforme (WHO grade IV) and anaplastic astrocytomas (WHO grade III).

In this clinical study, the investigators examine using a combination of these three peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment to prevent relapse of the disease for HLA-A\*2402-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients whose disease are controlled after any standard therapies.
NCT03662815	"Study Title: Clinical Study of a Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine in Treating Patients With Advanced Malignant Tumor. Brief Summary: This research study is evaluating a new type of cancer vaccine called ""Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine"" as a possible treatment for advanced malignant tumor. The purpose of the clinical study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and partial efficacy of the personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine in the treatment of Chinese patients with advanced malignant cancer, so as to provide a new personalized therapeutic strategy for advanced pancreatic cancer patients. It is known that cancer patients have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient and tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the participant's body fight any tumor cells that could cause the cancer to come back in the future. The study will examine the safety of the vaccine when given at several different time points and will examine the participant's blood cells for signs that the vaccine induced an immune response."

NCT02405585	"Study Title: Immunotherapy and SBRT Study in Borderline Resectable Pancreatic Cancer. Brief Summary: Unfortunately, despite the best clinical efforts and breakthroughs in biotechnology, most patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer continue to die from the rapid progression of their disease. One primary reason for this is that the disease is typically without symptoms until significant local and/or distant spread has occurred and is often beyond the chance for cure at the time of the diagnosis. The lack of any treatment to substantially increase long term survival rates is reflected by the poor outcomes associated with this disease, specifically time to disease progression and overall survival. However, another important part of the body is now being looked at as a target for therapy against this disease - the immune system. Scientists have clearly shown that pancreatic tumor cells produce a number of defective proteins, or express normal proteins in highly uncharacteristic ways, as part of this cancer. In some cancers, these abnormalities can cause an immune response to the cancer cells much in the way one responds to infected tissue. In progressive cancers however, the immune system fails to effectively identify or respond to these abnormalities and the cancer cells are not attacked or destroyed for reasons not yet fully understood. This clinical trial proposes a new way to stimulate the immune system to recognize pancreatic cancer cells and to stimulate an immune response that destroys or blocks the growth of the cancer. This new method of treatment helps the immune system of pancreatic cancer patients to ""identify"" the cancerous tissue so that it can be eliminated from the body. As an example, patients with certain diseases may require an organ transplant to replace a damaged kidney or heart. After receiving their transplant, these patients receive special drugs because they are at great danger of having an immune response that destroys or ""rejects"" the transplanted organ. This ""rejection"" occurs when their immune system responds to differences between the cells of the transplanted organ and their own immune system by attacking the foreign tissue in the same way as it would attack infected tissue. When the differences between foreign tissues and the patient's body are even larger, as with the differences between organs from different species, the rejection is very rapid, highly destructive, and the immunity it generates is longlasting. This is called hyperacute rejection and the medicine used to immunize patients in this protocol tries to harness this response to teach a patient's immune system to fight their pancreatic cancer just as the body would learn to reject a transplanted organ from an animal. To do this, Algenpantucel-L immunotherapy contains human pancreatic cancer cells that contain a mouse gene that marks the cancer cells as foreign to patient's immune systems. The immune system therefore attacks these cancer cells just as they would attack any truly foreign tissue, destroying as much as it can. Additionally, the immune system is stimulated to identify differences (aside from the mouse gene) between these cancer cells and normal human tissue as foreign. This ""education"" of the immune system helps treat the patient because pancreatic cancer cells already present in a treated patient are believed to show some of the same differences from normal tissue as the modified pancreatic cancer cells in the product. Due to these similarities, the immune system, once ""educated"" by the Algenpantucel-L immunotherapy, identifies the patient's cancer as foreign and attacks. Historically, external beam radiation has been part of the treatment of pancreatic cancer, both before and after surgical resection. Recent breakthroughs in technology now allow for more intensive doses of radiation to be delivered to the body with greater precision. These newer, more precise radiation treatments, called stereotactic body radiation, deliver more intensive radiation to a locally advanced tumor and are now being employed in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Stereotactic body radiation may increase the chances that surgery will successfully remove a pancreatic cancer. In this experimental study, all patients will be given a strong combination of antitumor chemotherapy while receiving injections of an immunotherapy drug consisting of two types of pancreatic cancer cells that have been modified to make them more easily recognized and attacked by the immune system. The investigators propose to test this new treatment paradigm along with stereotactic body radiation in patients with borderline resectable pancreatic cancer to demonstrate that treatment with this combination of therapies increases the time until the tumor progresses as well as overall survival."
NCT01403285	Study Title: Peptide-based Glioma Vaccine IMA950 in Patients With Glioblastoma. Brief Summary: BACKGROUND: Active immunotherapy of cancer is based on the premise that the vaccine raises a cytotoxic immune response to tumor-associated antigens, thereby destroying malignant cells without harming normal cells. IMA950 is a therapeutic multi-peptide vaccine containing 11 tumor-associated peptides (TUMAPs) found in a majority of glioblastomas, and is designed to activate TUMAP-specific T cells. The use of 11 TUMAPs increases the likelihood of a multi-clonal, highly specific T-cell response against tumor cells leading to decreased likelihood of immune evasion of the tumor by down-regulation of target antigens. PURPOSE: The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of IMA950 when given with cyclophosphamide, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and imiquimod in patients with glioblastoma and to determine if IMA950 shows sufficient immunogenicity in these patients. ELIGIBILITY: Patients with histologically proven GBMs who have completed radiotherapy, and have stable disease following at least 4 cycles of adjuvant temozolomide.

NCT05101356	Study Title: A Cancer Vaccine (Labvax 3(22)-23) and GM-CSF Alone or in Combination With Pembrolizumab for the Treatment of Advanced Stage Adenocarcinoma. Brief Summary: This phase 1/2 trial tests the safety and effectiveness of a cancer vaccine called Labvax 3(22)-23 and GM-CSF alone or in combination with pembrolizumab in treating adenocarcinoma that has spread to other places in the body (advanced stage). Labvax 3(22)-23 is designed to target a specific antigen (labyrinthin), which is a protein found on the surface of adenocarcinoma tumor cells. Labyrinthin is a protein that is not expressed on normal cells in the skin, lungs, salivary glands, pancreas, nor other tissues. In adenocarcinoma, the tumor cells produce too much labyrinthin causing them to express this protein on the surface of the tumor cells. One way to control the growth of these tumor cells is to teach the immune system to generate an immune response against the labyrinthin protein by vaccination against labyrinthin. GM-CSF, or sargramostim, is a protein that acts as a white blood cell growth factor. It has also been shown to stimulate immune system. Thus, administration of GM-CSF may help to boost the immune system response when given together with the vaccine. This study may improve the general knowledge about Labvax 3(22)-23 and how the body may generate an immune response to kill adenocarcinoma tumor cells. In the second phase of the study, participants will also receive pembrolizumab, which may improve anti-cancer activity when given with Labvax 3(22)-23 and GM-CSF.

NCT01341496	Study Title: Tumor Cell Vaccines and ISCOMATRIX With Chemotherapy After Tumor Removal. Brief Summary: Background: - A tumor cell vaccine is an experimental cancer treatment. Cancer cells are collected from a patient and then used to develop a vaccine. The vaccine will produce an immune system response to help destroy other cancer cells in the body. Researchers are studying ways to improve these tumor cell vaccines. One way is to add an adjuvant. An adjuvant is a substance that brings about a stronger immune system response. ISCOMATRIX is an adjuvant that has been used safely in other clinical studies. But it has not been studied with certain tumor cell vaccines. Researchers want to find out whether a tumor cell vaccine with ISCOMATRIX, given along with cancer drug treatment, is a safe and effective way to slow or prevent tumor growth after tumor removal surgery. Objectives: - To assess the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell vaccines given with ISCOMATRIX and drug therapy after tumor removal surgery. Eligibility: - People at least 18 years of age who have had tumor cell vaccines developed from cells taken from surgically removed tumors. Design: * Patients will be screened with a physical examination, medical history, blood and urine tests, and imaging studies. * Patients will be treated with cyclophosphamide (once daily) and celecoxib (twice daily) for 7 days before the first vaccine dose. * Patients will receive the tumor cell vaccine once a month for 6 months. They will continue to receive drug therapy throughout the vaccine treatment. Patients will be monitored with regular blood tests and imaging studies. * After the first 6 months, patients who have an immune response to the vaccine will continue treatment with the vaccine and chemotherapy. They will also have regular blood tests and imaging studies. They will have this treatment for up to 24 months from the first vaccination or until they no longer have an immune response. * Participants will have followup visits for up to 5 years after the first vaccination, or until the tumor returns.

NCT00698711	Study Title: Vaccination of Prostate Cancer Patients With MUC-2-KLH Conjugate Plus the Immunological Adjuvant QS21. Brief Summary: The purpose of this research is to help us study a vaccine treatment for patients with prostate cancer. A vaccine is a medicine that teaches the body to destroy harmful infections and other foreign substances. The immune system is made up of many different types of cells, which fight infection and disease in your body. A vaccine may stimulate the immune system to destroy the cancer cells. It may also help to slow the growth of the cancer. The vaccine is a solution given as an injection given into or under the skin. It is made up of several parts. The first part is MUC-2, a protein present in many cancers, especially prostate cancer. MUC-2 is attached to a material called KLH or keyhole limpet hemocyanin. KLH is purified from a snail- like marine mollusk called a keyhole limpet and has been used for many years to boost immune responses in animals and in people. Attaching MUC-2 to KLH helps the immune system react to MUC-2. The mixture of MUC-2 attached to KLH is in turn mixed with a material called QS21, from the bark of a tree, which also helps the immune system to make more cancer- fighting cells. A vaccine like the one you will receive has been given to laboratory animals and been shown to produce an immune response in these animals.
NCT02366728	Study Title: DC Migration Study for Newly-Diagnosed GBM.

NCT02287428	"Study Title: Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine w RT Plus Pembrolizumab for Patients With Newly Diagnosed GBM. Brief Summary: This research study is studying a new type of vaccine as a possible treatment for patients with glioblastoma. This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the intervention to use for further studies. ""Investigational"" means that the intervention is being studied and that research doctors are trying to find more about it. It also means that the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the Personalized NeoAntigen Cancer Vaccine for any use in patients, including people with glioblastoma. The purpose of the initial study cohort (Cohort 1) is to determine if it is possible to make and administer safely a vaccine against glioblastoma by using information gained from specific characteristics of the participants tumor. It is known that glioblastomas have mutations (changes in genetic material) that are specific to an individual patient's tumor. These mutations can cause the tumor cells to produce proteins that appear very different from the body's own cells. It is possible that these proteins used in a vaccine may induce strong immune responses, which may help the body fight any tumor cells that could cause the glioblastoma to come back in the future. Three additional cohorts (1a, 1b, \& 1c) were added to the study following completion of accrual to the original study cohort (cohort 1). Each new cohort receives NeoVax and radiation therapy as administered to cohort 1 and will also receive pembrolizumab: cohort 1a patients will start pembrolizumab w/in 2 weeks after start of RT, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1b patients will start pembrolizumab 2-4 weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years; cohort 1c patients will receive a single dose of pembrolizumab administered within 2 weeks after start of RT, re-start 2-4 weeks after completion of NeoVax priming, and continue every 3 weeks for up to 2 years. The rationale for adding these new cohorts is: 1) to assess the safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab; and 2) to determine if the timing of anti-PD-1 administration impacts the immunogenicity of NeoVax. An additional sub-study cohort (1d) is being added for patients whose tumor is MGMT-methylated. Cohort 1d will enroll patients with tumors for which the MGMT status is methylated or partially methylated; patients on cohort 1d will receive standard daily temozolomide during radiation and as adjuvant therapy for up to six cycles following completion of radiation therapy. The rationale for adding cohort 1d is to determine the safety and feasibility of NeoVax when administered with pembrolizumab and temozolomide."

NCT00089778	"Study Title: Vaccine Treatment of Kidney Cancer. Brief Summary: This study will evaluate the safety and side effects of two experimental vaccines in patients with kidney cancer and determine whether the vaccines ""turn on"" an immune response to the cancer. Each vaccine contains one of two peptides (pieces of proteins) from the fibroblast growth factor 5 (FGF-5) antigen, a protein produced by some cancer cells, and an oil-based liquid called Incomplete Freud's Adjuvant (Montanide ISA-51) that enhances the immune response to the vaccine. Patients 16 years of age and older who have kidney cancer that has spread beyond the kidney or whose primary kidney tumor has been removed within 6 months before entering the study and are at high risk for disease recurrence may be eligible for this study. Patients must have tissue type human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group (HLA-A2) or human leukocyte antigen serotype within HLA-A A serotype group (HLA-A3) (determined by a blood test for human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing) and their tumors must produce the FGF-5 peptide. Candidates are screened with a physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), tumor biopsy (removal of a small sample of tumor for examination) in patients whose tumor is easily accessible, and scans (computed tomography (CT), bone scans) and x-rays if current scans are not available. Participants are divided into two groups according to their HLA type (HLA-A2 or HLA-A3) to receive the vaccine appropriate for their HLA type. They are then further divided into three groups: 1) Group 1 includes patients who do not need or are ineligible for treatment with interleukin-2 (IL-2), a protein made by certain infection-fighting white cells that helps fight tumors) and patients who have previously had IL-2 therapy; 2) Group 2 includes patients who require immediate treatment with IL-2; and 3) Group 3 includes patients whose cancer has been surgically removed but who are at risk for recurrence. Patients in Groups 1 and 3 receive two peptide injections four times a week every 3 weeks for up to a year, or until their tumor grows (or returns in patients in Group 3) or the side effects are too severe to continue. Tumors are evaluated with a physical examination and scans or x-rays every 12 weeks and blood tests are done every 3 weeks. Patients in Group 2 receive two peptide injections every day for 4 days, along with doses of IL-2 starting the day after the first peptide injection. The vaccines are given as injections under the skin of the thigh. IL-2 is infused through a vein over 15 minutes every 8 hours for up to 12 doses, depending on tolerance. The vaccine and IL-2 are repeated every 10 to 14 days, with tumor evaluations every 2 months. Patients stay in the hospital about 1 week during each treatment cycle to receive the IL-2. All patients undergo leukapheresis, a procedure for collecting large numbers of white blood cells. Blood is collected through a needle in an arm vein and flows through a cell separator machine, where the white cells are extracted. The rest of the blood is returned to the patient through the same needle or a needle in the other arm. The white cells are examined to evaluate how the vaccines change the action of immune cells. Some patients may undergo an additional biopsy of normal skin and tumor or lymph node to look at the effects of the vaccine on the immune cells in the tumor. Patients in Group 1 whose cancer grows and patients in Group C whose cancer returns may be offered IL-2 treatments as given to Group 2 patients, along with the peptide vaccine. If the disease responds to IL-2, the treatment may be repeated after 2 months."

PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with GM-CSF works in treating patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk myelodysplastic syndrome.
NCT04879888	"Study Title: Personalized Vaccine for Cancer Immunotherapy. Brief Summary: Due to their genetic instability, breast tumors that do not express receptors for Estrogens, Progestagens or amplify the Her2 / neu oncogene \[called triple-negative breast cancer (TNTC)\] and other tumors such as melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, accumulate numerous mutations that make them highly resistant to different regimens of chemo- or radiotherapy, thereby generating high morbidity and mortality. However, immunology can turn the genetic instability of tumors into the Achilles' tendon. Evidence of this has been revealed in Phase I clinical studies in patients with melanoma and lung cancer in an advanced stage of metastasis treated with Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4) to decrease immunosuppression, in whom peptides containing mutations presented in Major Complex molecules Histocompatibility of Class I (HCM I) of the tumor itself results in their recognition as ""foreign"" neo-antigens leading to the efficient destruction of the tumor by anti-tumor CD8 + T lymphocytes that are amplified when they are vaccinated with these peptides. For this reason, the identification of non-synonymous mutations of single amino acid and vaccination with 25 amino acid peptides that incorporate these mutations (synthetic vaccines) is emerging today as an alternative for immunotherapy of cancers responsible for high mortality in humans. In an approach that takes 16 weeks, today, it is possible to go from the analysis of the tumor's transcriptome (which allows identifying the universe of tumor mutations) to the patient's vaccination with a personalized vaccine that contains neo-antigens of his tumor. TNBC is the most aggressive breast tumor, representing around 25% of breast cancers in our environment. While generally, at least 30% of women with other types of metastatic breast cancer survive 5 years after diagnosis, most patients diagnosed with metastatic CMTN die within this time. The lack of selective therapies and the poor prognosis of patients with NTMC make their therapeutic management difficult, so the implementation of new therapies for this type of tumor is the main focus of researchers who seek more effective and selective treatments to improve the life expectancy of patients without compromising their quality of life. The genetic instability and high rate of mutations of the TNBC most likely favor the generation of neo-epitopes. Still, due to the immunosuppressive environment of the tumor, it escapes the immunosurveillance of the immune system. Despite the high mortality induced by this tumor, a percentage of patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with agents such as Doxorubicin and Cyclophosphamide (AC) + Taxanes respond to this chemotherapy regimen. In particular, the anti-tumor effect of AC is attributed to two things: (i) the direct cytotoxic effect on the tumor cell, (ii) the immunostimulation of T lymphocytes promoted by Immunogenic Cell Death (ICM) selectively induced by these drugs. Therefore, in this project, we propose to carry out the first clinical study in Colombia of vaccination of patients with TNBC with synthetic peptides that contain mutations of their own tumor to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of this type of personalized vaccine as a therapeutic alternative for this tumor. Achieving the specific objectives set out in this project would mean that we have been validated in Colombia the experimental design necessary to identify unique epitopes in tumors and demonstrate the safety and immunogenicity of these vaccines. We consider that having achieved the above; we will have taken an important step towards the implementation in our country of the use of this type of vaccine for immunotherapy not only of TNBC but of other tumors such as glioblastoma, gastric, esophagus, and pancreas, highly fatal due to its high mutation rate."

NCT04836793	Study Title: COVID-19-Study of Immune Responses Following Vaccination Against SARS-CoV-2. Brief Summary: T-cell adaptive immunity is known to be required to sustain a long term immunoglobulin production and a long term memory against several infections. Previous results suggest a lack in the generation of T-cell responses against CoV-N, M and S proteins among cancer patients exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus highlighting that cancer patients failed to mount a protective T-cell immunity. Given this context, our hypothesis is that COVID-19 vaccine candidates are not immunogenic in some cancer patients. Thus, the monitoring of CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses before and after vaccination might provide information related to the correlation between induction of CD4 T-cells (including helper follicular T-cells) by the vaccine and long-term IgG production (serological index). Additionally, the failure of COVID-19 vaccines in some patients should be monitor carefully in order to provide specific recommendations to avoid COVID-19 infections. The main objective is to assess humoral immune responses following COVID-19 vaccination in a population of cancer patients.

NCT00299728	Study Title: NY-ESO-1 Protein With Montanide and CpG 7909 as Cancer Vaccine in Several Tumors. Brief Summary: This is a Phase I, open-label, randomized study of NY-ESO-l protein with immune adjuvants CpG 7909 and Montanide ISA-51 VG in patients with tumors that often express NY-ESO-1. The vaccinations was to be administered subcutaneously every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Patients with any malignancy that is known to frequently express NY-ESO-1 were eligible, regardless of whether antigen expression in the autologous tumor could be demonstrated or not by either PCR or immunohistochemistry. The primary objective of the study was to define safety. Secondarily, the study was to evaluate whether patients developed a specific immunologic response to the NY-ESO-1 protein. Blood samples were to be obtained at baseline, prior to each vaccination, one week after each vaccination, and at the last study visit for the assessment of NY-ESO-1-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Cytokine secretion by NY-ESO-1-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, as a measure of T cell activation, was to be determined by FACS analysis. In addition, humoral immunity was to be determined by the presence of NY-ESO-1-specific antibodies which were to be assessed in all patients by ELISA. Disease status was to be assessed at baseline and 2-4 weeks after the fourth vaccination in patients with evaluable (measurable and non-measurable) disease.

NCT00433745	Study Title: Wilm's Tumor 1 (WT1) Peptide Vaccine for High Risk Hematologic Malignancy. Brief Summary: This study will determine the safety and effectiveness of an experimental vaccine in controlling the abnormal growth of cells in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS, also known as myelodysplasia), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). It will test whether the vaccine can increase the number of immune cells responding to the cancer and thereby slow progression of the illness, improve blood counts, reduce the need for transfusions of blood and platelets, or even achieve a disease remission. The vaccine contains part of a protein that is produced in large amounts by cells of patients with these cancers and an added substance called Montanide that helps the immune system respond to the vaccine. Sargramostim, another substances that boosts the immune response, is also given. Patients 18 to 85 years of age with MDS, AML, ALL or CML may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests, chest x-ray and bone marrow biopsy. Women of childbearing age also have a pregnancy test. Participants undergo the following: * Chemotherapy entering the study. * Leukapheresis to collect large amounts of white blood cells for infusion before vaccine administration. * Participants may need placement of a central line (plastic tube, or catheter) in the upper part of the chest to be used for giving chemotherapy, blood or platelet transfusions, antibiotics and white blood cells, and for collecting blood samples. * Weekly vaccine injections for nine weeks, given in the upper arm, upper leg or abdomen. * Sargramostim injections following each vaccination. * Standard of care treatment for MDS, AML, ALL or CML, which may include blood or platelet transfusions, growth factors, and drugs to control underlying disease and potential side effects of the vaccine. * Weekly safety monitoring, including vital signs check, brief health assessment, blood tests and observation after the vaccination, on the day of each vaccination. * Follow-up evaluations with blood tests and chest x-ray 3 weeks after the last vaccine dose and with blood tests and bone marrow biopsy 7 weeks after the last vaccine dose.
NCT00857545	Study Title: OPT-821 With or Without Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Peritoneal Cancer in Second or Third Complete Remission. Brief Summary: This randomized phase II trial studies OPT-821 and vaccine therapy to see how well they work compared with OPT-821 alone in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cancer that has decreased or disappeared, but the cancer may still be in the body. Biological therapies, such as OPT-821, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether OPT-821 is more effective with or without vaccine therapy in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or peritoneal cancer.

NCT00357461	Study Title: Ipilimumab With or Without Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Previously Treated Stage IV Melanoma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as ipilimumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Vaccines made from gp100 peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving ipilimumab together with vaccine therapy may be an effective treatment for melanoma. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying ipilimumab and vaccine therapy to see how well they work compared to ipilimumab alone in treating patients with previously treated stage IV melanoma.
NCT00499083	Study Title: Paclitaxel, Cyclophosphamide & Doxorubicin, Autologous Dendritic Cells & Surgery in Stage II/III Breast Cancer (Women). Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Injecting the patient's dendritic cells directly into the tumor may stimulate the immune system and stop tumor cells from growing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Hormone therapy using tamoxifen may fight breast cancer by blocking the use of estrogen by the tumor cells. Giving combination chemotherapy together with autologous dendritic cells before surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving radiation therapy and hormone therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving paclitaxel together with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin followed by autologous dendritic cells and surgery with or without radiation therapy and/or hormone therapy works in treating women with stage II or stage III breast cancer.
NCT00084383	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy Combined With Adjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Treating Patients With Resected Stage I or Stage II Adenocarcinoma (Cancer) of the Pancreas. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from gene-modified pancreatic cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving vaccine therapy together with chemotherapy and radiation therapy after surgery may kill any remaining tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving vaccine therapy together with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy works in treating patients with resected stage I or stage II adenocarcinoma (cancer) of the pancreas.

Brief Summary: This research study is studying the drugs called NeoVax (a new type of personalized neoantigen vaccine) in combination with CDX-301 and Nivolumab or Pembrolizumab as a possible treatment for melanoma. The names of the study drugs involved in this study are: * Personalized Neoantigen peptides (which combined with poly-ICLC make the vaccine NeoVax)\* Poly-ICLC (Hiltonol)\* CDX-301\* Nivolumab (Opdivo)\* Pembrolizumab (Keytruda).
NCT00000105	"Study Title: Vaccination With Tetanus and KLH to Assess Immune Responses. Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to learn how the immune system works in response to vaccines. We will give the vaccines to subjects who have cancer but have not had treatment, and to patients who have had chemotherapy or stem cell transplant. Some patients will get vaccines while they are on treatments which boost the immune system (like the immune stimulating drug interleukin-2 or IL-2). Although we have safely treated many patients with immune boosting drugs, we do not yet know if they improve the body's immune system to respond better to a vaccine. Some healthy volunteers will also be given the vaccines in order to serve as control subjects to get a good measure of the normal immune response. We will compare the patients and the healthy volunteers to study how their immune systems respond to the vaccines. There are several different types of white cells in the blood. We are interested in immune cells in the blood called T-cells. These T-cells detect foreign substances in the body (like viruses and cancer cells). We are trying to learn more about how the body fights these foreign substances. Our goal is to develop cancer vaccines which would teach T-cells to detect and kill cancer cells better. We know that in healthy people the immune system effectively protects against recurrent virus infection. For example, that is why people only get ""mono"" (mononucleosis) once under normal circumstances. When the body is infected with the ""mono"" virus, the immune system remembers and prevents further infection. We are trying to use the immune system to prevent cancer relapse. To test this, we will give two vaccines which have been used to measure these immune responses. Blood samples will be studied from cancer patients and will be compared to similar samples from normal subjects."
NCT02166905	Study Title: DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 Fusion Protein CDX-1401, Poly ICLC, and IDO1 Inhibitor INCB024360 in Treating Patients With Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer in Remission. Brief Summary: This partially randomized phase I/IIb trial studies the side effects and best dose of IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 in combination with DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 and poly ICLC and to see how well they work in treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who no longer have evidence of disease. Antigens (such as cancer/testis antigen \[NY-ESO-1\] protein) are found on many cancer cells. Vaccines made from NY-ESO-1 protein may cause the immune system to produce immune cells and antibodies that may help locate the NY-ESO-1 and/or cancer/testis antigen 2 (LAGE-1) antigens on cancer cells. By finding them, the immune system may then work to control or eliminate the remaining cancer cells. INCB024360 is an inhibitor of an enzyme called indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO). This enzyme is produced by tumor cells to disable immune cells, and limit the efficacy of immune attack. Giving DEC-205/NY-ESO-1 fusion protein CDX-1401 with poly ICLC and IDO1 inhibitor INCB024360 may generate stronger and more long lasting anti-cancer immune responses in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer in remission.
NCT01152398	Study Title: A Safety and Immunology Study of a Modified Vaccinia Vaccine for HER-2(+) Breast Cancer After Adjuvant Therapy. Brief Summary: The current trial, BNIT-BR-003, will evaluate the safety and biological activity of a fixed dose of MVA-BN-HER2 following adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with HER-2-positive breast cancer. The intent of vaccination is to induce a combined antibody and T-cell anti-HER-2 immune response, which is intended to target HER-2-expressing tumor cells, and may induce tumor regression or slow progression of disease.
NCT05638698	"Study Title: Tg01 Vaccine / Qs-21 Stimulon With Or Without Balstilimab As Maintenance Therapy Following Adjuvant Chemotherapy In Patients With Resected Pancreatic Cancer. Brief Summary: Researchers want to discover if the new drug ""TG01"" will work with participants' bodies to help their immune system attack any cancer cells that might still be in the blood stream after surgery for pancreatic cancer. The researchers will also investigate whether or not ""TG01"" combined with the other study drug, ""Balstilimab"", will show even greater efficacy. TG01 and Balstilimab are both experimental treatments and are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as treatment in the United States, or elsewhere, for pancreatic cancer or any other type of cancer. Balstilimab has been studied in other cancers and has shown signs of efficacy. Another drug will be used in this study called ""QS-21"". It is not intended to treat any disease but is used in this study to improve the action of the study drug TG01. QS-21 has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to be mixed with a vaccine used to prevent shingles. It has not been approved to be mixed with the study drug, TG01. Participants will undergo eligibility screening, weekly visits during treatment when receiving the study drug or study drug combination, two safety follow-up visits, at about 30 and 90 days after the last dose of study treatment, and long term follow up for about 12 months after the last dose of study treatment."

NCT03282188	Study Title: REO13 Melanoma With of Without GM-CSF. Brief Summary: Open-label, non-randomised, single centre study which will assess the presence of reovirus (Reolysin), following intravenous administration with or without Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) given to patients prior to surgery for metastatic melanoma. All patients will receive an initial low 'immunisation' dose of intravenous reovirus. Patients will be enrolled sequentially in to each of the two cohorts receiving either reovirus alone, or reovirus plus GM-CSF. For this study we anticipate 8-16 evaluable patients, up to 8 for each group. The endpoints of this study will compare the 2 treatment groups for reovirus tumour infiltration and replication. Compare the neutralising antibody development and cell-mediated immune response and identify any adverse events and laboratory toxicities.
NCT02204098	Study Title: Safety and Immune Response to a Mammaglobin-A DNA Vaccine In Breast Cancer Patients Undergoing Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy. Brief Summary: The purpose of this research study is to find out about the safety of injecting the gene (DNA) for mammaglobin-A into people with breast cancer. The DNA used in this study was purified from bacteria and contains the gene for mammaglobin-A. Mammaglobin-A is a protein that is highly expressed by breast cancer cells. Injection of mammaglobin-A DNA may be a way to generate an immune response to breast cancer cells. There is evidence that an immune response may be a way to fight cancer. In addition to evaluating the safety of the mammaglobin-A injection, this study is also looking at the immune response that the participant's body has after each injection.
NCT01082198	Study Title: Melanoma Vaccine in Treating Patients With Stage III Melanoma After Surgery to Remove Lymph Nodes.

PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best way to give melanoma vaccine in treating patients with stage III melanoma after surgery to remove the lymph nodes.
NCT01143545	Study Title: Pilot Study of Allogeneic Tumor Cell Vaccine With Metronomic Oral Cyclophosphamide and Celecoxib in Patients Undergoing Resection of Lung and Esophageal Cancers, Thymic Neoplasms, and Malignant Pleural Mesotheliomas. Brief Summary: Background: - Certain types of lung, esophageal, or thymic cancers and mesotheliomas have specific antigens (protein molecules) on their surfaces. Research studies have shown that giving a vaccine that contains antigens similar to these may cause an immune response, which may keep tumors from growing. Researchers are also interested in determining whether the chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide and the anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib may help the vaccine work better, particularly in patients with lung cancer. Objectives: - To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of tumor cell vaccines in combination with cyclophosphamide and celecoxib in patients with cancers involving the chest. Eligibility: - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have had surgery for small cell or non-small cell lung cancer, esophageal cancer, thymoma or thymic carcinoma, and malignant pleural mesothelioma. Design: * Following recovery from surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation, participants will have leukapheresis to collect lymphocytes (white blood cells) for testing. * Participants will receive celecoxib and cyclophosphamide to take twice a day at home, 7 days before the vaccine. * Participants will have the vaccine in the clinical center (one or two shots per month for 6 months), and will stay in the clinic for about 4 hours after the vaccine. Participants will keep a diary at home of any side effects from the vaccine, and will continue to take cyclophosphamide and celecoxib. * One month after the sixth vaccine, participants will provide another blood sample for testing, and if the tests are satisfactory will return to the clinic every 3 months for 2 additional vaccines. * Participants will return to clinic for follow-up physical examinations, lab tests, and scans every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for up to 3 years.

NCT00499577	Study Title: Stem Cell Transplant, Chemotherapy, and Biological Therapy in Treating Patients With High-Risk or Refractory Multiple Myeloma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer cells by stopping blood flow to the cancer. A stem cell transplant using stem cells from the patient may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill cancer cells. Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells after the transplant may help destroy any remaining cancer cells. PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of stem cell transplant given together with chemotherapy and biological therapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with high-risk or refractory multiple myeloma.
NCT03166254	Study Title: Personalized Therapeutic Anti-tumor Vaccine With Pembrolizumab and Standard of Care Chemotherapy in Squamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Extensive Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer. Brief Summary: Both metastatic squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and extensive stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are incurable with current therapies, but due to mutations induced by cigarette smoke, typically express a large number of altered proteins that can be recognized as foreign by the immune system. This antigenicity is thought to explain the efficacy of pembrolizumab as either a first or second line treatment in this disease. For patients who receive chemotherapy plus immunotherapy as a first line therapy, there is sound rationale for combination treatment with immunotherapy and a therapeutic antitumor vaccine as a maintenance strategy. Regardless of PD-L1 expression in the tumor, monoclonal antibodies that block PD-1/PD-L1 interactions are effective second line therapies after chemotherapy in both NSCLC and SCLC. In addition, by targeting the immune system against tumor specific antigens using a peptide vaccine, the efficacy of pembrolizumab alone is expected to be enhanced, with an improved response rate and prolonged overall survival with no additional toxicity. This pilot study will provide a preliminary test of the feasibility of generating a personalized, tumor neoantigen-specific therapeutic vaccine and the safety of combining it with checkpoint blockade immunotherapy.
NCT03395587	Study Title: Efficiency of Vaccination With Lysate-loaded Dendritic Cells in Patients With Newly Diagnosed Glioblastoma.
