Abstract: Impairments in anti-influenza T helper 1 (Th1) responses are associated with greater risk of influenza-related mortality in the elderly. Addition of adjuvants to existing influenza vaccines could improve immune responses in the elderly. In this study, the activity of three adjuvants, an oil-in-water emulsion and a synthetic lipid A adjuvant formulated with or without the emulsion, is compared. Our results show that Fluzone combined with lipid A plus an emulsion effectively leads to greater vaccine-specific IgG2a and IgG titers, enhances hemagglutination-inhibition titers and induces Type 1 cytokine responses (IFN-gamma and IL-2) to each of the Fluzone components.
