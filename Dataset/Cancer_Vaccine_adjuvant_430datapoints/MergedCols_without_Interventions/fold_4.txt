NCT05685004	Study Title: Study of Neoantigen-specific Adoptive T Cell Therapy for Newly Diagnosed MGMT Negative Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM). Brief Summary: This randomized study is designed to compare the combination of TVI-Brain-1 immunotherapy and standard therapy compared to standard therapy alone as a treatment for newly diagnosed MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma patients. The patients' own cancer cells collected after surgery are combined into a vaccine to produce an immune response that significantly increases the number of cancer neoantigen-specific effector T cell precursors in the patient's body. These cancer neoantigen-specific T cells are harvested from the blood, subsequently stimulated and expanded, and infused back into the patient.
NCT00705640	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Melanoma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccine therapy may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with advanced melanoma.
NCT00079144	Study Title: Lymphocyte-Depleting Nonmyeloablative Preparative Chemotherapy Followed By Autologous Lymphocyte Infusion, Peptide Vaccine Plus Montanide ISA-51, and Interleukin-2 in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Treating a person's lymphocytes in the laboratory and reinfusing them may replace immune cells destroyed by chemotherapy. Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving a vaccine with Montanide ISA-51 may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's lymphocytes to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well lymphocyte-depleting nonmyeloablative (not damaging to bone marrow) chemotherapy followed by autologous lymphocyte infusion, peptide vaccine plus Montanide ISA-51, and interleukin-2 works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.
NCT00002767	Study Title: Interferon Alfa With or Without Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether melanoma vaccine plus interferon alfa is more effective than interferon alfa alone in treating patients with metastatic melanoma. PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interferon alfa with or without vaccine therapy in treating patients with metastatic melanoma.
NCT01949701	Study Title: Safety and Efficacy Study of Epitope Peptide To Treat HLA-A*02 Disease Controlled Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. Brief Summary: The investigators previously identified a novel HLA-A\*0201-restricted epitope peptide, which was derived from a cancer-testis antigen, URLC10 as a target for vaccination against lung cancer. In this clinical study, the investigators examine using the peptides the safety, immunogenicity, and antitumor effect of vaccine treatment to prevent relapse of the disease for HLA-A\*0201-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients whose disease are controlled after any standard therapies.
NCT01989572	Study Title: Sargramostim, Vaccine Therapy, or Sargramostim and Vaccine Therapy in Preventing Disease Recurrence in Patients With Melanoma That Has Been Removed By Surgery. Brief Summary: This randomized phase III trial studies sargramostim or vaccine therapy alone to see how well they work compared to sargramostim and vaccine therapy together in preventing disease recurrence in patients with melanoma that has been removed by surgery. Sargramostim may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. It is not yet known whether yeast derived sargramostim and vaccine therapy are more effective alone or together in preventing recurrence of melanoma.
NCT03199872	Study Title: RV001V, a RhoC Anticancer Vaccine, Against Metastasis From Solid Tumours. Brief Summary: The study will evaluate safety and immunological response to RhoC peptide vaccine in patients with prostate cancer.
NCT00633204	Study Title: Peptide Vaccine Focusing on Prevention of the Recurrence for Bladder Cancer. Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy for the prevention of the recurrence for bladder cancer after TUR-Bt.
NCT02054104	Study Title: Adjuvant Tumor Lysate Vaccine and Iscomatrix With or Without Metronomic Oral Cyclophosphamide and Celecoxib in Patients With Malignancies Involving Lungs, Esophagus, Pleura, or Mediastinum. Brief Summary: Background: During recent years, cancer-testis (CT) antigens (CTA), particularly those encoded by genes on the X chromosome (CT-X genes), have emerged as attractive targets for cancer immunotherapy. Whereas malignancies of diverse histologies express a variety of CTAs, immune responses to these proteins appear uncommon in cancer patients, possibly due to low-level, heterogeneous antigen expression, as well as immunosuppressive regulatory T cells present within tumor sites and systemic circulation of these individuals. Conceivably, vaccination of cancer patients with tumor cells expressing high levels of CTAs in combination with regimens that deplete or inhibit T regulatory cells will induce broad immunity to these antigens. In order to examine this issue, patients with primary lung and esophageal cancers, pleural mesotheliomas, thoracic sarcomas, thymic neoplasms and mediastinal germ cell tumors, as well as sarcomas, melanomas, germ cell tumors, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or mediastinum with no evidence of disease (NED) or minimal residual disease (MRD) following standard multidisciplinary therapy will be vaccinated with H1299 tumor cell lysates with Iscomatrix adjuvant. Vaccines will be administered with or without metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50 mg by mouth (PO) twice a day (BID) x 7day (d) every (q) 14d), and celecoxib (400 mg PO BID). Serologic responses to a variety of recombinant CTAs as well as immunologic responses to autologous tumor or epigenetically modified autologous Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) transformed lymphocytes will be assessed before and after a six month vaccination period. Primary Objectives: 1. To assess the frequency of immunologic responses to CTAs in patients with thoracic malignancies following vaccinations with H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix(TM) vaccines alone in comparison to patients with thoracic malignancies following vaccinations with H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix vaccines in combination with metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib. Secondary Objectives: 1. To examine if oral metronomic cyclophosphamide and celecoxib therapy diminishes the number and percentage of T regulatory cells and diminishes activity of these cells in patients with thoracic malignancies are at risk of recurrence. 2. To examine if H1299 cell lysate/Iscomatrix(TM) vaccination enhances immunologic response to autologous tumor or epigenetically modified autologous EBV-transformed lymphocytes (B cells). Eligibility: * Patients with histologically or cytologically proven small cell or non-small cell lung cancer (SCLC;NSCLC), esophageal cancer (EsC), malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), thymic or mediastinal germ cell tumors, thoracic sarcomas, or melanomas, sarcomas, or epithelial malignancies metastatic to lungs, pleura or mediastinum who have no clinical evidence of active disease (NED), or minimal residual disease (MRD) not readily accessible by non-invasive biopsy or resection/radiation following standard therapy completed within the past 26 weeks. * Patients must be 18 years or older with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 - 2. * Patients must have adequate bone marrow, kidney, liver, lung and cardiac function. * Patients may not be on systemic immunosuppressive medications at time vaccinations commence. Design: * Following recovery from surgery, chemotherapy, or chemo/radiotherapy (XRT), patients with NED or MRD will be vaccinated via IM injection with H1299 cell lysates and Iscomatrix(TM) adjuvant monthly for 6 months. * Vaccines will be administered with or without with metronomic oral cyclophosphamide and celecoxib. * Systemic toxicities and immunologic response to therapy will be recorded. Pre and post vaccination serologic and cell mediated responses to a standard panel of CT antigens as well as autologous tumor cells (if available) and EBV-transformed lymphocytes will be assessed before and after vaccination. * Numbers/percentages and function of T regulatory cells in peripheral blood will be assessed before, during, and after vaccinations. * Patients will be followed in the clinic with routine staging scans until disease recurrence. * The trial will randomize 28 evaluable patients per arm to either receive vaccine alone or vaccine plus chemotherapy in order to have 80% power to determine if the frequency of immune responses on the combination arm exceeds that of the vaccine alone arm, if the expected frequencies of immune responses on the two arms were 20% and 50%, using a one-sided 0.10 alpha level Fisher's exact test. * Approximately 60 patients will be accrued to this trial.
