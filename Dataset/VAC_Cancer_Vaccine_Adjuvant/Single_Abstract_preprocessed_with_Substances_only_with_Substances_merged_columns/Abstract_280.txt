Abstract: Metastatic cancer accounts for 90% of all cancer-related deaths and continues to be one of the toughest challenges in cancer treatment. A growing body of data indicates that S100A9, a major regulator of inflammation, plays a central role in cancer progression and metastasis, particularly in the lungs, where S100A9 forms a premetastatic niche. Thus, we developed a vaccine against S100A9 derived from plant viruses and virus-like particles. Using multiple tumor mouse models, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the S100A9 vaccine candidates in preventing tumor seeding within the lungs and outgrowth of metastatic disease. The elicited antibodies showed high specificity toward S100A9 without cross-reactivity toward S100A8, another member of the S100A family. When tested in metastatic mouse models of breast cancer and melanoma, the vaccines significantly reduced lung tumor nodules after intravenous challenge or postsurgical removal of the primary tumor. Mechanistically, the vaccines reduce the levels of S100A9 within the lungs and sera, thereby increasing the expression of immunostimulatory cytokines with antitumor function [(interleukin) IL-12 and interferonγ] while reducing levels of immunosuppressive cytokines (IL-10 and transforming growth factorβ). This also correlated with decreased myeloid-derived suppressor cell populations within the lungs. This work has wide-ranging impact, as S100A9 is overexpressed in multiple cancers and linked with poor prognosis in cancer patients. The data presented lay the foundation for the development of therapies and vaccines targeting S100A9 to prevent metastasis.Keywords:S100A9; bacteriophage; metastasis; plant virus; vaccine.
