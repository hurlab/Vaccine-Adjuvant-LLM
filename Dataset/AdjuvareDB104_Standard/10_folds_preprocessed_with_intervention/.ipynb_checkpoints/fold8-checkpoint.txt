NCT00199836	A Pilot Study of NY-ESO-1b Peptide Plus CpG 7909 and Montanide ISA-51 in Patients With Cancer.	This cancer vaccine research study involves the injection of the NY-ESO-1b peptide along with 2 other agents to help stimulate the immune system. Peptides are small fragments of protein. NY- ESO-1 peptides are normally found in the testis and the placenta. They have also been found on various types of cancer cells. The purpose is to stimulate the immune system to react against the peptides that are found on cancer cells.	BIOLOGICAL: NY-ESO-1b peptide plus CpG 7909 and Montanide ISA-51
NCT00006041	Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer	RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill the tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer.	BIOLOGICAL: MUC1-KLH conjugate vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: MUC1-KLH vaccine/QS21|BIOLOGICAL: QS21
NCT00616720	Interferon-gamma or Aldesleukin and Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Multiple Myeloma	RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as interferon-gamma and aldesleukin, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells. Giving biological therapy together with vaccine therapy may kill more cancer cells. PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving aldesleukin or interferon gamma together with vaccine therapy works in treating patients with multiple myeloma.	BIOLOGICAL: aldesleukin|BIOLOGICAL: idiotype-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine APC8020|BIOLOGICAL: recombinant interferon gamma|GENETIC: polymerase chain reaction|GENETIC: reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction|OTHER: flow cytometry|OTHER: laboratory biomarker analysis
NCT00002505	Tumor Cell Vaccine in Treating Patients With Advanced Cancer	RATIONALE: Vaccines made from the patient's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response and kill their tumor cells. PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of autologous tumor cell vaccination plus immunologic adjuvant in treating patients who have metastatic cancer.	BIOLOGICAL: filgrastim|BIOLOGICAL: recombinant interferon gamma|BIOLOGICAL: tumor cell lysate vaccine therapy
NCT03014076	Immunotherapy Vaccine and Herceptin in Breast Cancer	The purpose of this trial is to determine if combination immunotherapy with HER2/neu GP2 peptide + GM-CSF vaccine and trastuzumab is safe and immunologically effective in treatment of patients with HER2/neu over-expressing breast cancer in the adjuvant setting. While not a primary endpoint, time to recurrence is measured for enrolled subjects. The objectives of the study are the following: * Assess safety and document local and systemic toxicity to combination immunotherapy with GP2 peptide + GM-CSF vaccine and trastuzumab. * Evaluate the in vitro and in vivo immunologic responses to combination immunotherapy of GP2 peptide + GM-CSF vaccine and trastuzumab. * Determine maximum tolerated dose and optimal biologic dose for the combination immunotherapy of GP2 peptide + GM-CSF vaccine and trastuzumab	DRUG: GP2 peptide + GM-CSF vaccine plus trastuzumab|DRUG: Trastuzumab
NCT02593227	Folate Receptor Alpha Peptide Vaccine With GM-CSF in Patients With Triple Negative Breast Cancer	This Phase II trial evaluates the safety and immunogenicity of two doses of the Folate Receptor Alpha (FRα) peptide vaccine mixed with GM-CSF as a vaccine adjuvant, with or without a immune priming with cyclophosphamide, as a consolidation therapy after neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment of patients with Stage IIb-III triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).	BIOLOGICAL: Low dose FRα vaccine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|BIOLOGICAL: High dose FRα vaccine
NCT00001440	Autologous T-Cell Transplantation and the Immunotherapy of Residual Disease in Breast Cancer: Pilot Study of Vaccine-Driven T-Cell Expansion in Patients Treated With Dose-Intensive Chemotherapy	The ability of chemotherapy to cure cancer, including breast cancer, has been limited by drug resistant residual tumor cells remaining after chemotherapy that generally result in relapse. Additional therapeutic strategies to eradicate these residual tumor cells are needed. The augmentation of specific anti-tumor immune responses, such as those mediated by T-cells, might represent such an additional strategy for the control or elimination of residual tumor cells. This approach might be especially effective if T-cell mediated responses were enhanced during both the period of T-cell repopulation that follows acute T-cell depletion and in the setting of minimal residual tumor burden present after dose intensive chemotherapy. Such chemotherapy is known to result in severe T-cell depletion. This pilot study has been designed to examine the feasibility of combining dose intensive chemotherapy with interventions aimed at the reconstitution of T-cell immunity. Metastatic or adjuvant breast cancer patients who have received dose intensive chemotherapy will subsequently receive a combination of autologous chemotherapy-naive T-cells, a patient-specific tumor antigen vaccine, and recombinant human interleukin-2. These interventions will be assessed for their ability to modulate T-cell number, T-cell function, and T-cell specificity during the period of T-cell repopulation. Such modulation may result in the effective reconstitution of generalized T-cell immunity with the generation of vaccine-specific anti-tumor T-cell responses.	PROCEDURE: Autologous T cells|DRUG: Interleukin-2
NCT00705640	Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Advanced Melanoma	RATIONALE: Vaccine therapy may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with advanced melanoma.	BIOLOGICAL: incomplete Freund's adjuvant|BIOLOGICAL: multi-epitope melanoma peptide vaccine|BIOLOGICAL: tetanus toxoid helper peptide|PROCEDURE: biopsy
NCT02938442	Vaccination of Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients	The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new investigational cancer vaccine, P10s-PADRE in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery in patients with clinical stage I, II or III triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study will compare the vaccine plus standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery alone.	BIOLOGICAL: P10s-PADRE with MONTANIDE ISA 51 VG + Doxorubicin + Cyclophosphamide + Paclitaxel|DRUG: Doxorubicin + Cyclophosphamide + Paclitaxel
