Abstract: Background:Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an important cause of illness in older adults. This study assessed efficacy of a vaccine for prevention of RSV-associated acute respiratory illness (ARI), defined by specified symptoms with virologic confirmation.Methods:This phase 2b study evaluated RSV postfusion F protein (120 µg) with glucopyranosyl lipid adjuvant (5 µg) in 2% stable emulsion. Subjects aged ≥60 years were randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 to receive vaccine or placebo (all received inactivated influenza vaccine). Ill subjects recorded symptoms and provided blood and nasal swab samples.Results:In the per-protocol population (n = 1894), the incidence of RSV-associated ARI occurring ≥14 days after dosing was 1.7% and 1.6% in the vaccine and placebo groups, respectively, for a vaccine efficacy (VE) of -7.1% (90% confidence interval [CI], -106.9%-44.3%). Efficacy was not observed in secondary analyses that included seroresponse to nonvaccine RSV antigens (VE, 8.9%; 90% CI, -28.5%-35.4%) or symptoms combined with seroresponse (VE, 10.0%; 90% CI, -45.4%-44.4%). On day 29, 92.9% of vaccinees had an anti-F immunoglobulin G antibody seroresponse. Overall, 48.5% and 30.9% of RSV vaccine recipients reported local and systemic solicited symptoms, respectively.Conclusion:The RSV vaccine was immunogenic but did not protect older adults from RSV illness.Clinical trials registration:NCT02508194.Keywords:Adjuvant; clinical trial; efficacy; respiratory syncytial virus; subunit; vaccine.
