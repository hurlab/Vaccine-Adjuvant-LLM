Abstract: Background:Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is an important cause of moderate to severe diarrhoea in children for which there is no licensed vaccine. We evaluated ETVAX®, an oral, inactivated ETEC vaccine containing four E. coli strains over-expressing the major colonization factors CFA/I, CS3, CS5, and CS6, a toxoid (LCTBA) and double mutant heat-labile enterotoxin (dmLT) adjuvant for safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity.Methods:A double-blind, placebo-controlled, age-descending, dose-finding trial was undertaken in 40 adults, 60 children aged 10-23 months, and 146 aged 6-9 months. Adults received one full dose of ETVAX® and children received 3 doses of either 1/4 or 1/8 dose. Safety was evaluated as solicited and unsolicited events for 7 days following vaccination. Immunogenicity was assessed by evaluation of plasma IgA antibody responses to CFA/I, CS3, CS5, CS6, and LTB, and IgG responses to LTB.Results:Solicited adverse events were mostly mild or moderate with only 2 severe fever reports which were unrelated to the vaccine. The most common events were abdominal pain in adults (26.7 % in vaccinees vs 20 % in placebos), and fever in children aged 6-9 months (44 % vs 54 %). Dosage, number of vaccinations and decreasing age had no influence on severity or frequency of adverse events. The vaccine induced plasma IgA and IgG responses against LTB in 100 % of the adults and 80-90 % of the children. In the 6-23 months cohort, IgA responses to more than 3 vaccine antigens after 3 doses determined as ≥2-fold rise was significantly higher for 1/4 dose compared to placebo (56.7 % vs 27.2 %, p = 0.01). In the 6-9 months cohort, responses to the 1/4 dose were significantly higher than 1/8 dose after 3 rather than 2 doses.Conclusion:ETVAX® was safe, tolerable, and immunogenic in Zambian adults and children. The 1/4 dose induced significantly stronger IgA responses and is recommended for evaluation of protection in children.Clinical trials registration:The trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR Ref. 201905764389804) and a description of this clinical trial is available on: https://pactr.samrc.ac.za/Trial Design.Keywords:Diarrhoea; ETEC; ETVAX®; Immunogenicity; Safety; Vaccine; Zambia.
