NCT00923195,"Radiation, Chemotherapy, Vaccine and Anti-MART-1 and Anti-gp100 Cells for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma",https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT00923195,,COMPLETED,"Background:

* Melanoma antigen recognized by T-cells (MART-1) and gp100 are two genes found in melanoma cells. An experimental procedure developed for treating patients with advanced melanoma uses these genes and a type of virus to make special cells called anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells, which are designed to destroy the patient's tumor. The cells are created in the laboratory using the patient's own tumor cells or blood cells.
* The procedure also uses one of two vaccines-the anti-MART-1 peptide or the anti-gp100 peptide-to stimulate cells in the immune system that may increase the effectiveness of the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells. Both vaccines are made from a virus that is modified to carry a copy of the MART-1 gene or gp100 gene. The virus cannot cause disease in humans.

Objectives:

- To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells and peptide vaccines for treating patients with advanced melanoma.

Eligibility:

- Patients 18 years of age with metastatic melanoma for whom standard treatments, including aldesleukin (IL-2) therapy to boost immune response, have not been effective.

Design:

* Participants have an initial evaluation with complete medical history, as well as scans, x-rays, and other tests as directed by researchers. Most of the treatments for this study will be given on an inpatient basis.
* Before the treatment begins, participants will undergo leukapheresis (removal of selected blood cells) to obtain cells for preparing the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells, and for later stem cell transplantation.
* Preinfusion treatment: 5 days of chemotherapy and 2 days of total-body irradiation to prepare the immune system for receiving the anti-MART-1 and anti-gp100 cells.
* Infusion of cells, followed by IL-2 treatment to improve immune response. IL-2 is given as a 15-minute infusion through a vein every 8 hours for a maximum of 15 doses (over 5 days).
* After the cell infusion, participants will be divided into two groups and will receive either the gp100 peptide or MART-1 vaccine, given once a week for 3 weeks. Participants will also have stem cell transplantation (from previously collected stem cells) to promote cell survival.
* Periodic follow-up clinic visits after hospital discharge for physical examination, review of treatment side effects, laboratory tests and scans every 1 to 6 months.",YES,Melanoma|Skin Cancer,DRUG: MART-1: 26-35(27L) Peptide|DRUG: Montanide ISA 51 VG|DRUG: gp100:154-162 Peptide|PROCEDURE: Radiation|DRUG: Aldesleukin|DRUG: Fludarabine|DRUG: Cyclophosphamide|GENETIC: Anti-gp 100:154 TCR PBL|GENETIC: Anti-MART-1 F5 TCR PBL,"Complete Response Rates for Patients With Metastatic Melanoma, Complete response was assessed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

* Most patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and many patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) have a protein called Wilm's Tumor 1 (WT1) in their cancer cells. This protein is thought to be able to influence the growth of these cancers.
* A vaccine made with the WT1 protein may boost the immune system to help fight these cancers in patients whose cancer cells contain the protein.

Objectives:

* To determine the safety, effectiveness and side effects of giving the WT1 vaccine and donor white blood cells to patients with AML, ALL, CML or NHL who have previously received standard treatment and undergone stem cell transplantation.
* To determine the immune response to the WT1 vaccine and donor white blood cells in these patients and to determine if the response is related to the amount of WT1 protein in the patient's cancer cells.

Eligibility:

* Patients between 1 and 75 years of age with the blood antigen human leukocyte antigen (HLA-A2) and the WT1 cancer protein who have persistent or recurrent blood cancers after stem cell transplantation.
* The prior stem cell transplant donor must be willing to provide additional cells, which will be used to prepare the cellular vaccines and for donor lymphocyte (white blood cell) infusions.

Design:

* Patients are given the WT1 vaccine every 2 weeks for 6 weeks (weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10). Each vaccination consists of two injections in the upper arm or thigh.
* On weeks 0, 4 and 8, patients also receive white blood cells from a donor to enhance the immune response. The cells are also given as a 15- to 30-minute infusion through a vein about 1 hour after the vaccine injection.

Additional therapeutic strategies to eradicate these residual tumor cells are needed. The augmentation of specific anti-tumor immune responses, such as those mediated by T-cells, might represent such an additional strategy for the control or elimination of residual tumor cells. This approach might be especially effective if T-cell mediated responses were enhanced during both the period of T-cell repopulation that follows acute T-cell depletion and in the setting of minimal residual tumor burden present after dose intensive chemotherapy. Such chemotherapy is known to result in severe T-cell depletion. This pilot study has been designed to examine the feasibility of combining dose intensive chemotherapy with interventions aimed at the reconstitution of T-cell immunity. Metastatic or adjuvant breast cancer patients who have received dose intensive chemotherapy will subsequently receive a combination of autologous chemotherapy-naive T-cells, a patient-specific tumor antigen vaccine, and recombinant human interleukin-2. These interventions will be assessed for their ability to modulate T-cell number, T-cell function, and T-cell specificity during the period of T-cell repopulation.

The goals of vaccine development in the current study are to develop vaccines: 1) with improved potency and 2) which are more effective at inducing cell-mediated immune responses. The selection of GM-CSF as the immunological ""adjuvant"" is a direct extension of our laboratory studies in small animal models demonstrating that GM-CSF can enhance the potency of the prototype Id-KLH vaccine by augmenting almost exclusively the cellular arm of the immune response.

The objectives of this study are: 1) to evaluate cellular and humoral immune responses against the unique idiotype of the patient's lymphoma and 2) to evaluate the ability of the Id vaccine to clear the bone marrow of malignant cells detectable by pathologic examination or molecular examination (polymerase chain reaction amplification of the rearranged bcl-2 oncogene).

The goal of this study is to treat previously untreated patients with follicular lymphomas to complete remission or minimal residual disease with ProMACE chemotherapy. Three to six months after completion of chemotherapy, in an effort to reduce the relapse rate (by eradicating microscopic disease resistant to chemotherapy), patients will receive an autologous Id vaccine administered in combination with GM-CSF.
