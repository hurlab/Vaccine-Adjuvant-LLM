Abstract: Yersinia enterocoliticacauses a severe enteric infection in infants and young children. There is no vaccine approved for use in humans. We investigated the immunogenicity and protective capacity ofYersiniaYopB, a conserved type III secretion system protein, alone or combined with LcrV in adult mice immunized intranasally. YopB or LcrV (5 μg) administered with theEscherichia colidouble mutant heat-labile toxin (dmLT) adjuvant afforded modest (10-30%) protection against lethalY. enterocoliticaoral infection. The combination of YopB and LcrV (5 μg each) dramatically improved vaccine efficacy (70-80%). Additionally, it afforded complete protection againstY. pestispulmonary infection. Immunization with YopB/LcrV+dmLT resulted in Ag-specific serum IgG, systemic and mucosal Ab-secreting cells, as well as IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-2, IL-6, IL-17A, and KC production by spleen cells. Serum Abs elicited by YopB/LcrV+dmLT had enhanced bactericidal and opsonophagocytic killing activity. AfterY. enterocoliticachallenge, YopB/LcrV+dmLT-vaccinated mice exhibited intact intestinal tissue, active germinal centers in mesenteric lymph nodes, IgG+and IgA+plasmablasts in the lamina propria, and Abs in intestinal fluid. On the contrary, complete tissue destruction and abscesses were seen in placebo recipients that succumbed to infection. Mice immunized as infants with YopB+dmLT or LcrV+dmLT achieved 60% protection against lethalY. enterocoliticainfection, and vaccine efficacy increased to 90-100% when they received YopB/LcrV+dmLT. YopB+dmLT also afforded substantial (60%) protection when administered intradermally to infant mice. YopB/LcrV+dmLT is a promising subunit vaccine candidate with the potential to elicit broad protection againstYersiniaspp.
