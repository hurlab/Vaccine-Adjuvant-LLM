Abstract: The invasion of reticulocytes by Plasmodium vivax merozoites is dependent on the interaction of the Plasmodium vivax Duffy Binding Protein (PvDBP) with the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC). The N-terminal cysteine-rich region II of PvDBP (PvDBPII), which binds DARC, is a leading P. vivax malaria vaccine candidate. Here, we have evaluated the immunogenicity of recombinant PvDBPII formulated with the adjuvants Matrix-M and GLA-SE in mice. Analysis of the antibody responses revealed comparable ELISA recognition titres as well as similar recognition of native PvDBP in P. vivax schizonts by immunofluorescence assay. Moreover, antibodies elicited by the two adjuvant formulations had similar functional properties such as avidity, isotype profile and inhibition of PvDBPII-DARC binding. Furthermore, the anti-PvDBPII antibodies were able to block the interaction of DARC with the homologous PvDBPII SalI allele as well as the heterologous PvDBPII PvW1 allele from a Thai clinical isolate that is used for controlled human malaria infections (CHMI). The cross-reactivity of these antibodies with PvW1 suggest that immunization with the PvDBPII SalI strain should neutralize reticulocyte invasion by the challenge P. vivax strain PvW1.
