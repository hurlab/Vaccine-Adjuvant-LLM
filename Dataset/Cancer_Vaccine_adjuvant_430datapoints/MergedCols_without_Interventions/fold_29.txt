NCT Number	Study Summary
NCT00089206	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage III or Stage IV Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with stage III or stage IV melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery.
NCT04166006	Study Title: A Phase II Study on Adjuvant Vaccination With Dendritic Cells Loaded With Autologous Tumor Homogenate in Resected Stage IV Rare Cancers. Brief Summary: Single-arm, monocentric trial to assess safety and immunological efficacy of adjuvant vaccination with autologous dendritic cells loaded with autologous tumour homogenate after curative resection for stage IV rare cancers (In Head/Neck tumors (H\&N), NEuroendocrine Tumors (NET) and Soft Tissue Sarcomas (STS).
NCT00518206	Study Title: Study of NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX in Patients With Measurable Stage III or IV Melanoma. Brief Summary: This was a Phase 2, open-label study of the NY-ESO-1 ISCOMATRIX (ISCOM) vaccine administered as an intramuscular injection given every 4 weeks to subjects with measurable advanced malignant melanoma. Study objectives included determination of the anticancer activity, cellular and humoral immunogenicity, and safety and tolerability of the NY-ESO-1 ISCOM vaccine administered alone or preceded by a single administration of low-dose cyclophosphamide.
NCT03122106	Study Title: Neoantigen DNA Vaccine in Pancreatic Cancer Patients Following Surgical Resection and Adjuvant Chemotherapy. Brief Summary: This is a phase 1 open-label study to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a neoantigen DNA vaccine strategy in pancreatic cancer patients following surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. The neoantigen DNA vaccines will incorporate prioritized neoantigens and personalized mesothelin epitopes and will be administered with an electroporation device. The hypothesis of this study is that neoantigen DNA vaccines will be safe and capable of generating measurable neoantigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.
NCT00693342	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy and OPT-821 or OPT-821 Alone in Treating Patients With Ovarian Epithelial Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer in Complete Remission. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from tumor antigens may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as OPT-821, may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Giving vaccine therapy together with OPT-821 may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known whether giving vaccine therapy together with OPT-821 is more effective than OPT-821 alone in treating ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer. PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying vaccine therapy and OPT-821 to see how well they work compared with OPT-821 alone in treating patients with ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer in complete remission.
NCT00523159	Study Title: IMA901 in Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients With Measurable Disease. Brief Summary: This study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the cancer vaccine IMA901 and GM-CSF as adjuvant in the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. Patients received vaccination with GM-CSF followed by IMA901 during the study period of 9 months. Patients received pre-treatment with a single i.v. infusion of cyclophosphamide prior to the first vaccination.
NCT02938442	Study Title: Vaccination of Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients. Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to evaluate a new investigational cancer vaccine, P10s-PADRE in combination with standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery in patients with clinical stage I, II or III triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). This study will compare the vaccine plus standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery alone.
NCT03574649	Study Title: QUILT-2.024: Phase 2 Neoadjuvant, Consolidation, and Adjuvant Combination NANT Immunotherapy Versus Standard of Care in Subjects With Resectable Non-small Cell Lung Cancer. Brief Summary: This is a randomized phase 2 study to compare the efficacy of neoadjuvant, consolidation, and adjuvant immunotherapy (NANT NSCLC Combination Immunotherapy; experimental arm) to standard of care (surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy; control arm) in subjects with stage II-IIIa resectable NSCLC.
NCT02543749	"Study Title: DC Vaccination in CML. Brief Summary: The aim of this phase I/II trial is induction of anti leukemic T cell immunity in a clinical situation of ""minimal residual disease"". This might be a strategy to immunologically eradicate the residual leukemia cells. Patients to be included are chronic phase bcr/abl+ CML (chronic myeloid leukemia) patients in stable cytogenetic and/or molecular remission. These patients can be included if they have: 1. not achieved a CMR (complete molecular response) or 2. achieved bcr/abl \< 10% on qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) (=MCyR) (Major cytogenic Response), but less than a CCyR (complete cytogenic Response). Autologous DC (Dendritic cells), generated under GMP (Good manufacturing conditions) conditions, are used as a vaccine. These DC constitutively express all putative tumor antigens. In order to ensure sufficient presentation of distinct CML-related antigens, particularly in good responders to TKIs, DC are additionally pulsed with peptides from bcr/abl, WT-1 (Wilms Tumor Protein) and proteinase-3. Monitoring of T cell reactivity against these peptides can then serve as surrogate marker for anti leukemic immunity induced by the vaccine. Vaccination is performed with 10\^7 DC i.d. (intra dermal) in weeks 1, 3, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23 and 26. KLH (keyhole limpet hemocyanin) is used as an adjuvant for vaccine preparations in weeks 3, 5 and 8 (and 11)."
NCT00004249	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 in Treating Patients With Small Cell Lung Cancer That Has Responded to Initial Therapy. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Biological therapies, such as QS21, use different ways to stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus QS21 in treating patients who have small cell lung cancer that has responded to initial therapy.
