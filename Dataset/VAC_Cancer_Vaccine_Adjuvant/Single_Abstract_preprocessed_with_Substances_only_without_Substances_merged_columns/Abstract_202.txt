Abstract: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of lower respiratory tract infections among infants with most infections occurring in the first year of life. Multiple RSV exposures are required for children to mount adult-like immune responses. Although adult RSV immunity is associated with less severe disease, the protection induced through natural infection is short-lived. Therefore, vaccination of RSV-experienced young children may accelerate immunity and provide long-term protection from RSV reinfection. However, the extent to which different Th-biased vaccine regimens influence pre-existing humoral and cellular immunity in RSV-experienced young children is unknown. To address this question, infant BALB/c mice were RSV-infected and subsequently immunized with the prefusion RSV F (PreF) antigen formulated with either a Th2-skewing (Alum) or Th1/Th2-balanced (Advax-SM) adjuvant. These studies show that both adjuvants boosted neutralizing antibody and protected from RSV reinfection, but Advax-SM adjuvant prevented the Th2-skewed immunity observed in RSV-experienced young mice immunized with PreF/Alum.Keywords:Mice; RSV; Th1/Th2-balanced; Vaccination; Young.
