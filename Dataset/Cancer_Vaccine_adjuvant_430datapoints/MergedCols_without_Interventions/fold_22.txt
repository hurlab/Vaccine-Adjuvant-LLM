NCT Number	Study Summary
NCT00295958	Study Title: LMB-2 Immunotoxin and Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Metastatic Melanoma That Cannot Be Removed By Surgery. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: The LMB-2 immunotoxin can find tumor cells and kill them without harming normal cells. Vaccines made from peptides may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Giving LMB-2 immunotoxin together with vaccine therapy may kill more tumor cells. PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving LMB-2 immunotoxin together with vaccine therapy works in treating patients with metastatic melanoma that cannot be removed by surgery.
NCT02411786	Study Title: A Phase I Study of a DNA Vaccine Encoding Androgen Receptor Ligand-Binding Domain (AR LBD) +/-GMCSF. Brief Summary: The purpose of this study is to determine if a vaccine called pTVG-AR can enhance the participant's immune response against prostate cancer.
NCT00091286	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Stage IIB, Stage III, or Stage IV Colorectal Cancer. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from peptides may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying how well vaccine therapy works in treating patients with stage IIB, stage III, or stage IV colorectal cancer.
NCT01867086	Study Title: Salvage Ovarian FANG Vaccine + Carboplatinum. Brief Summary: This is a Phase II study of Vigil autologous tumor cell vaccine integrated with carboplatinum. All patients will have Vigil prepared and stored from ovarian tumor cells obtained at the time of primary surgical debulking. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will receive either carboplatinum alone (AUC 6/30 minute infusion) or carboplatinum (AUC 5/30 minute infusion) and taxol (175 mg/m2/3 hour infusion) one day prior to Vigil 1.0 x 10e7 cells/intradermal injection, once every 3 weeks.
NCT05807035	Study Title: Autologous Tumour Vaccine Trial. Brief Summary: Phase 1 trial to evaluate the feasibility of preparation, safety, tolerability and response to a personalised autologous tumour vaccine (ATV) formulated with Advax adjuvant when administered to patients with advanced solid cancers either as monotherapy or in combination with other standard of care agents.
NCT05307835	"Study Title: Neoantigen Vaccine in Esophagus Cancer Patients Following Neoadjuvant Therapy and Surgical Resection. Brief Summary: This research study is evaluating a new type of esophagus cancer vaccine called ""Personalized Neoantigen Cancer Vaccine"" as a possible treatment for esophagus cancer patients who have completed adjuvant therapy following neoadjuvant therapy and surgical resection. The purpose of the clinical study is evaluating the safety, tolerability and partial efficacy of the personalized neoantigen cancer vaccine in the treatment of resectable esophagus cancer, so as to provide a new personalized therapeutic strategy."
NCT00004918	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy Plus Immune Adjuvant in Treating Patients With Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, Acute Myeloid Leukemia, or Myelodysplastic Syndrome. Brief Summary: Vaccines made from peptides that are found on leukemia cells may make the body build an immune response and kill cancer cells. Combining vaccine therapy with the immune adjuvant Montanide ISA-51 may be a more effective treatment for chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and best dose of vaccine therapy when given with Montanide ISA-51 and to see how well they work in treating patients with chronic myeloid leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome.
NCT00003819	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy Plus QS21 in Treating Patients With Progressive Prostate Cancer. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy given with QS21 in treating patients who have progressive prostate cancer.
NCT00006041	Study Title: Vaccine Therapy in Treating Patients With Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Peritoneal Cancer. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill the tumor cells. PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy in treating patients who have ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer.
NCT00082641	Study Title: Neoadjuvant/Adjuvant Chemotherapy, Vaccine & Adjuvant Radiation Therapy in p53-Overexpressing Stage III Breast Cancer. Brief Summary: RATIONALE: Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor cells. Giving vaccine therapy before and/or after chemotherapy and radiation therapy may cause a stronger immune response. PURPOSE: This randomized phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of two regimens of vaccine therapy and to see how well they work in treating women who are receiving neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation therapy for stage III breast cancer that overexpresses p53.
